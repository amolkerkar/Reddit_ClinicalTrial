SeveralString5058,"i feel this post. i’m m and i always thought i  loved coffee until i realized that it was turning my hair gray, preventing me from sleeping adequately, and led me to smoking copious amounts of marijuana to deal with caffeine inflicted anxiety. this combination turned into a vicious cycle of caffeine stimulation in the morning and afternoon and subsequent cannabis use to take the edge off from the caffeine in the evening. i would regularly consume a venti iced black coffee from starbucks throughout the day, sometimes having a grande in the afternoon if i had to work that evening (i’m a bartender). it would be a miracle if i could make it through my shift without getting stoned, as i was so agitated from the caffeine that talking to people was like pulling teeth. i just thought i hated my job and that maybe i was turning into a cynical asshole. nope. it was coffee.  i have tried to quit caffeine upwards of  times within the past year, failing miserably each time until now. each time i failed, i went cold turkey and tried to “tough it out”.  this time i used matcha powder. i found it to be very easy to ween using matcha because the dose is very consistent and precise. there is something like  or so mg of caffeine per teaspoon of matcha. maybe start with two of those in the morning in a latte with milk, one in the afternoon, and a half teaspoon at night.  i’m  days off of my last matcha drink (i tapered down to / of a teaspoon) and i’d be surprised if i ever had caffeine again. good luck with your journey! this forum has been incredibly helpful, so i advise you to continue reaching out for help and kind words. everyone is very supportive and friendly!",0.007505555555555556,0.6089658119658119,"Dear [Author's Name],
