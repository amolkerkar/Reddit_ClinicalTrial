"less anxiety, acid reflux, negative thinking. more balanced emotions, calm centered thinking and relaxing nights.",0
"same, it’s kind of wild. sleep off of caffeine is so deep and restful. i don’t remember feeling this rested in my life! since i quit caffeine i can only sleep in pitch darkness. when i drank caffeine i was… afraid of the dark? i always had a night light and my anxiety was up. i didn’t correlate it with lingering caffeine in my body. wasn’t till i removed it that i could really sense the difference. anyways- it’s awesome!!",1
"i've been doing cold showers after waking up, doing wim hof breathing technique can activate sympathetic nervous system, adrenal glands. i eat a lot of bananas or a fruit juice smoothie, i get naked juice sometimes for the convenience.  finding a hot beverage that you like to replace coffee can fill the act of drinking something for energy, if you are in the habit of drinking coffee everyday. i drink dandelion root tea with oat milk. since you no longer have  caffeine as a crutch, you have to look for other ways to get energy. healthy foods and exercise. sometimes i'll drop and do ten pushups for blood flow, jumping jacks, squats, anything. actively keeping up with your energy to get out of the caffeine cycle, and know it can only get better the more time away, the more time for your brain to adapt.",0
"this is simply untrue. magnesium absorption is very complex, just like it is with most vitamins and minerals. it’s not as simple as - magnesium is in x amount in x food, so as long as i eat some of that i’ll be good. there’s a huge amount of antagonists in your food and environment that prevent absorption of nutrients - and in plants, that can be phytic acid which inhibits absorption of minerals. large amounts of fiber that comes with them also inhibits absorption and increases how much you lose. coffee, tea, stress, sweating, exercise, processed foods, soda to name just a few mess with magnesium status. it also needs to be in balance with other minerals in your body, like vitamin d, calcium and b. deficiencies in vitamin d and b are so common you can pretty much assume you have them.  gut problems also decrease absorption, and they are also so incredibly common now that you have to factor that in, as you can have them even with zero symptoms. and we have lost enormous amounts of minerals in our food due to over industrialisation and misuse of land. the rda for many nutrients is not enough due to how low we are in them now, it can take months or longer to get levels up, and the amount of nutrients in foods varies a lot, and our database isn’t at all completely accurate.  every health source that knows a lot about this will tell you need a supplement unless you’re in really good health and eating an absurdly healthy organic diet, which most people simply can’t",0
"the test is how you feel. is your sleep good, are you tired, anxious?  i think theres a test that involves checking cofactors like potassium. i would recommend going on cronometer.com and entering what you eat in a day. itll list how much youre getting of every nutrient and magnesium is on the list. men need mg, women mg per day. if what youre getting isnt even close (like mine), do your research on how to get it all into your diet + get a good supplement like magnesium glycinate.  this youtube doctor recommends  cups of salad per day. you can substitute that with other stuff you prefer of course, but it think this puts it in perspective.

"welcome! good for you on making this decision so early in your life. making this change is going to pay dividends to your health overall.  first, being aware that the withdrawal symptoms that you’re experiencing are because you’ve made this change is huge. might sound weird, but some of us have accidentally cut caffeine for one reason or another and didn’t realize what we were experiencing was withdrawal. this gives you a bit of a mental advantage.  understand that the symptoms are temporary and will get easier with time. we’re all different and have varying circumstances that play into our situations; some of us cut only caffeine, some cut caffeine and nicotine, others like myself caffeine and processed foods and sugar, the list goes on. i’m into week  and last night i slept  hours uninterrupted for the first time since /.  in terms of coping, breathing exercises to get my nervous system back in check, taking it slowly and being kind to myself were critical. my productivity halted weeks - and i began to make improvements week -. everyday a little bit better. don’t let the anxiety rule you-own that shit and consciously keep hold of your life. i say that because there is a choice to succumb and be afraid and not do certain things or avoid tasks because it feels like the safe thing to do…. don’t. that’s how some of us get stuck in the loop of fear. breathing is key here and know that your brain chemistry is evolving for the better.  be mindful about how your framing thoughts/ideas- don’t kick your own ass because your sleep is changing. do your best to be kind to yourself and work with what life is presenting you. much of this is a mental game. don’t believe everything you think. this was a big one for me. your brain will not be happy about your choice to deprive it of caffeine.  work on sleep hygiene, ways to care for your gut, and getting outside/connecting with people/your support system while you work through this. it’s critical to understand that it takes time to undo what years of use has done to our brains. caffeine teaches us instant gratification and go! go! go! removing it brings you back to reality. we’re dealing with a polarity. life has a funny way of kicking you in the ass sometimes and forces you to slow down and heal if that’s what we want.  it won’t be easy and by the sound of it you’re one of the “lucky ones” that has to work through the hefty symptoms. you will come out the other side stronger and better for it. congrats again on your decision to quit— the only way out is through! you got this!",1
"i'd like to recommend breathing excercices. coherent breathing for  minutes or box breathing does wonders for me, when my caffeine withdrawl anxiety kicks in. the first  weeks are the worst, imo.  hang in there, you can do it and you've been doing great so far!",0
i’ve been going through the same anxiety after i quit energy drinks. it’s normal and it goes away. make sure you watch catovideo’s videos on youtube if you need support,1
"from all the studies i've seen,  hours is usually the upper limit, here's a chart graphing some data from participants - (notice that the max half life in this data set is hours) it's not just caffeine that's the problem though, caffeine metabolizes into paraxanthine which is similar to caffeine (and will induce anxiety/restlessness/sleep issues just the same), and has a long half life as well (up to over  hours!), here's another chart averaging caffeine and paraxanthine blood levels in participants -  notice in the above graph how even after  hours there was still elevation of stimulants in the blood, this is averaged from slow and fast metabolizers though, in slow metabolizers caffeine will still be strongly elevated at  hours, and paraxanthine will be extremely elevated still now, the next problem is paraxanthine metabolizes into -methylxanthine, which is another stimulant like caffeine/paraxanthine, which has a various half life. all together, if you're a slow metabolizer, after a single dose of caffeine you'll have psychoactive stimulants in your blood for up to  days, having adenosine blocked (and gaba being damaged) for  days means not only will you have the psychoactive effects going for about a week, but you'll have the recovery/withdrawal phase (from even a single dose), all in all after a single dose, if you're a slow metabolizer, it can takes weeks to recover, or longer. sources on caffeine/paraxanthine half life - source on the claim that methylxanthines damage gaba receptors - ",0
"hey. i’m also  and i quit energy drinks cold turkey about  months ago after i had a panic attack and went to the er with heart palpitations for the first time in my life. i’ve been having about -mg a day for  years or so. it’s been the toughest  months of my entire life. first two weeks i had extreme anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, depersonalization. i felt like i was losing my mind. it’s gotten better, but still tough. dealing with depression and anxiety still. also i’ll add that i’m a totally normal kid with no physical or mental health issues. it’s a ride. feel free to reach out to me if you need anything.",1
"depersonalization is the worst thing i have ever experienced. it goes away, and it comes in waves. for me it caused extreme anxiety, like i thought i was going insane. i do not wish it on anyone. to anyone else reading, stay positive if you experience it. going through mental battles like that will make you stronger in the end. find something to keep you busy, focus on the present. that's what helped me. edit:  clarification",1
"i'm in my second week, caffeine free for about  days. my dopamine seems to fluctuate a lot, but i know i'm in the healing process.  the number one thing i noticed is that i never actually needed coffee to stay awake. (i'm physically fit) what i was using it for was for the dopamine rush that it provided. but because the dopamine rush comes with the side effects of anxiety, it made the social aspects of my life worse. i work at with a lot of people so socialzing is a key aspect of my life, but caffeine made interactions way to quick. now caffeine free i pay more attention to the little details, especially in conversation my reading of facial expressions is improved. this whole decaf things feels exactly like my nofap journey years ago. seems like quitting one thing just led me to rely on something else for that easy dopamine, but i'm excited to get my mental space back. i used to be very imaginative and mellow and after a while that went away. now i can pin point it to all the energy drinks i drank for my gym habit. lately, i've been feeling better in many aspects, but the mood changes from calm to irritable do get to me and i know it's the withdrawal symptoms. at the same time, i believe caffeine was only a bandaid to cover what we really feel and with caffeine we don't try to discipline who we really are. caffeine, the escape drug to get through those storms, but i think we must pick better habits to control them like meditation and cardio.",1
one thing i noticed after quitting caffeine was the deeper sleep i was getting. normally i would wake up at /am thinking oh shit i’ve got to go to work and then realising i’ve still got another few hours and now i sleep the whole way through and don’t wake up in anxious state.,1
"looks like we stopped almost at the same time, i also stopped caffeine and nicotine a little more than  weeks ago now. i personally did it because i thought i'd rather go through  withdrawals at the same time than doing one after the other, aside of casually sweating and being extremely tired for a few days there weren't as many withdrawal symptoms as i had always feared. now for nicotine that might be since i only smoked for almost a year and i generally didn't smoke in the evenings or weekends, but for caffeine, i drank so many energy drinks and so much coffee in the last decade, i guess i was lucky with my symptoms. congrats on your progress :",1
for sure! an upregulated nervous system with an excessive production of un-needed stress hormones. makes sense that it would make us feel like something is wrong!,0
of course you cannot blame caffeine for “everything in your life”.  but in my opinion caffeine absolutely *causes* anxiety.,1
i use very small amount of caffiene to poteniate it and add a small dopamine boost which i believe it does guess i'm lucky as i get no speedy or anxious effect whatsoever i just feel a kick to my meds which is what i hoped for starting it.since i do this i read a bit on caffiene and from what i read in the brain it's good for you nuetoprotrctive the medical articles stated it's positive effects on dopamine have proved it to protect against parkinson alzheimer's and demtia as well as revers damage from alcohol.itvalsovstayef it could used in sparingly amounts to boost most antidepressants .with this i'm well aware it's a stimulant and sure along with the good it does have dangers like blood pressure heart rate etc that all stims carry bit the good i read you did come from accredited medical source so i d finally agree with you along with its downsides caffeine apparently according to the article can do some good,1
"thanks for your story! i’m on a similar journey. cut out nicotine first and then alcohol. caffeine was the last one to go and potentially the hardest. went on and off so many times. like you, i used decaf and green tea to start breaking my  cup a day habit. about two weeks completely off now and feeling great. anxiety has dropped off a cliff and starting to feel like my old self again.  this sub has been helpful to see that there are many others feeling the same way. best of luck! ",1
"taurine works on the gaba system, i.e. has a calming effect. additionally, even decaf causes some anxiety due to one of the thousands compounds that are psychoactive (possibly mao inhibitors)",0
"same for me. after drinking coffee i feel restless+anxious, i get very irritable/angry and start ruminating about the most random things. when i drink coffee for several days my hair loss gets significantly worse and i feel stressed out which makes me procrastinate a lot. but when i drink redbull or any other brand (in my case zero sugar) i feel a nice energy boost without the racing thoughts. when i drink to much energy drinks i still get shaky and i can really feel that there is to much adrenalin in my body, but overall not nearly as bad as with coffee. but when i drink zero caffeine there is still a huge improvement in sleep quality and a big reduction in overall mental and physical tension. based on what ive read so far there are compounds in coffee which antagonize/inhibit the mao-a and b enzyme which could cause the anxiety and racing thoughts. could be something totaly different thats just my guess + i get nauseous from green and black tea so mabye there is a problem with some plant substances i cant tolerate in general. but somewhat glad to hear im not the only one with that issue ",1
this happens to me. it was one particular brand of energy drink that a  ml can made me feel good for three days. tea or coffee gives me an instant anxiety though.,1
"coffee makes me crash harder and think weird anxious thoughts at night instead of sleeping. oddly enough, the same mg of caffeine in tea or yerba mate doesn’t do this to me. so, at least i know not to drink coffee, what a shame though because it’s delicious.",1
a lot of energy drink contain l-theanine which is an amino acid that has a calming effect (found naturally in things like green tea). taking l-theanine with caffeine eliminates the anxiety it causes for a lot of people including myself.,1
"energy drinks have l-theanine in them , which is a natural anti anxiety ingredient which occurs in green tea. this why people often feel less jittery on green tea then coffee (as well as the lower caffeine content)  additionally, coffee is not so simple to track the caffeine content in and may be varying dramatically from cup to cup",1
same for me until it became the opposite. energy drinks will spike my anxiety now,1
"i can have a coffee every now and then, but if i drink it regularly, it makes me feel like garbage. anxiety, irritability, and muscle tension. if i drink matcha or black tea, i'm great.",1
"you never quit you just reduced and now you want to increase again? go ahead it won't kill you. if you find it disrupts your or sleep or makes you anxious, just cut back again",0
"yes, i drank maybe  cups a week. since quitting  ( months ago) i realized caffeine made my anxiety and ocd significantly worse",1
"i switched from a morning coffee to a morning black tea and it made a huge difference in my anxiety, even though i’m still having some caffeine.",1
"i drank - cups of black tea a day. quit  weeks ago and i feel so much better. better sleep, less anxious. thought i needed caffeine for work but i in fact work better off of caffeine now. my work was very sporadic on caffeine.",1
"as a stimulant it definately has effect on anxiety and ocd. i used to be a very nervous person. anxiety and ocd was common in my life. i even got my eyes wet often for no particular reason. but all that is gone and i still drink coffee. so the answer to your question is yes and no. more positive effect i had with cutting out all stress in my life, being happy with myself, healthy diet, good sleep, lots of physical activity, no alcohol.",1
"i used to drink  cups of coffee a day. my anxiety since quitting has gotten a lot better, i wake up less groggy, i sweat less. (lol)",1
"i am still trying to quit from  cup per day (sometimes a lungo or just instant coffee, i probably average around mg of caffeine per day right now). yes even the relatively small amounts cause me some anxiety in the evening. sort of feeling of pending doom (many people have reported this in this subreddit). i also think that on a deeper level it somehow inhibits emotions.",1
"i went from  cups of coffee all the way down to just black tea. i would have one, maybe two a day. since quitting altogether, my wife says i am a different person. i am way less irritable, and stressed all the time. even a small amount makes a big difference.",1
"i drank - cups of coffee a day, and i switched to decaf about  months ago to see if it would make a difference to my teeth grinding and tiredness. it didn't really. i haven't noticed a significant effect on my anxiety, although i obviously don't get the caffeine jitters, which is a plus. i don't think i can go back on it though, as i have lost my tolerance.",1
"yes, i was quite a moderate caffeine drinker. one small cup of coffee or cacao per day. this amount still had really bad effects on my health! and the addiction was so powerful. anxiety, irritability, speediness, anger, sleeplessness, confusion, brain fog, etc.  if you are using caffeine regularly, the effects are very strong, even in small amounts.",1
"one cup definitely should not worsen symptoms. i did  and in addition to stomach acid problems i was in a bad mood all the time but my life was kind of stressful these days also so i think this was the main reason. i like coffee and around ml is ok for me, i sleep well and have no anxiety. people often forget that stress is already there and coffee will worsen it. remove the cause of stress and drink your coffee again.",0
"your comment is very low iq. cold showers probably reliese more, % normal dopamine for many hours. ether way theyre not mutually exclusive, you can still excersize after cold showers.   cold showers are very healthy, building up brown fat cells etc. id say being lazy is not taking advantage of cold showers.  dopamine is part of your nervous system, most pleasure is dopamine or seratonin. 'dopamine addict' is a nonesense statement.",0
"as you age,  you  need to shed all these addictive habbits. 'vices' become cumbersome. the aging body cant cope. my weekly routine was  uncomfortably reliant on my coffee hits each day. stopping and queuing to buy the 'coffee-to-go' on the way to work was  ridiculous and not fair on my work mate waiting in the ute.    i was becoming irritable  and my mood unstable. anxiety was creeping up. blood pressure meds boarderline on being increased. the real turning point, however,  was; the breakdown of a valued friendship.  on reflection,  if i was more intune and less caffine hyped...i would  have managed  so much better.",1
"- getting tired, woozy, dizzy from drinking coffee - realizing all the money lost from buying coffee and energy drinks for absolutely no benefits aside from keeping caffeine withdrawals at bay - the anxiety, the stress over nothing, the depression, the high blood pressure, the heart palpitations - can't even go on a vacation without you constantly looking for the next place where you can get your caffeine fix - i went from  to  years of age without being caffeine addicted, and finished school etc. just fine, so i can clearly live without caffeine now as older as well - caffeine is keeping my dopamine levels high consistently, which basically makes life less interesting since you are already having and running high dopamine. i don't want to live like this. - i did a genetic test. it says i have slow comt, and a mutation in the cypa gene. long story short, i suck at metabolizing caffeine and its effects. caffeine lingers for longer in my system, and so do dopamine, noradrenaline and cortisol.",1
"it would cause me anxiety to the point i felt my heart pounding in my throat, and that transferred to morning road rage if i was commuting.",0
"i've had messed up digestion ever since i became a caffeine addict. i also developed a panic disorder. i don't blame caffeine itself, but constant consumption can cause or exacerbate health issues.",1
anxiety attacks and very light sleep. one evening i was freaking out for no reason and something clicked. i had some black tea half an hour ago. next time i had tea i waited to observe the reaction and again the anxious panic feeling. i knew then. came on reddit to see if someone else has experienced it too and found this sub. never looked back.,1
"quitting caffeine is useful, but i also want to recommend you might try a book called unwinding anxiety because i have had panic attacks while driving even after i quit caffeine if the road is unfamiliar to me.",1
"my anxiety worsened during covid times to become more of intrusive medical and hypochondria thoughts. also, just in general my body felt like shit and i'd be in so much pain upon waking sometimes - like everything hurt. i started in january by going cold turkey off of sugar. then it was social media. then caffeine. i will say i am feeling a bit better though i'm in the early stages on caffeine: only day  fully without it and i do feel so groggy and out of it.",1
"digestive issues, really bad anxiety, joints pain and tight muscles such that sneezing and coughing was really painful. other issues as well that all seem to diminish and improve significantly just after  days of being caffeine free...",1
"heart palpitations was the last straw for me. i could deal with the perennial anxiety, the tight chest, the broken sleep, and the lack of patience, apparently, but the heart skipping one beat out of seven did the trick.",1
"well, my anxiety is linked to family problems. very serious ones. that is why my mom and dad got very tough and controlling. they don't even show that they actually like me and appreciate me. also, i've been a 'different child' since i was a baby. ",1
"yeah, it doesn’t matter how you have the anxiety what you wanna do is control it and i found this book worked really well. i got it from the library.",0
"remember caffeine makes you more stressed, even if it gives you a drug high initially it's literally its mechanism of action to increase stress hormones in your body. consider if you're addicted to stress and adrenaline, so you want to hit a high gear when you're already spinning instead of learning to manage your stress. it's a recipe for burnout and illness later in life, better try and get a handle over caffeine misuse now.",0
"your current habit is to consume something that makes you even more stressed when you’re already stressed. like when you put you hand on a stove and if fucking hurts. you want it to hurt. that’s how you know you’re doing something that’s not good for you! see that what you’re doing is innocently really dumb. when you really see that you’ll stop doing it, the same way when you really see that putting your hand on a hot stuff is a bad idea so you just don’t do it. you don’t need willpower or anything. you just stop because you see it’s obviously a studio thing to do.  and it’ll probably require you to feel you feelings, and learn new habits.",0
"awesome! i have quit a variety of stuff (methadone, benzodiazepines, alcohol) caffeine is a different animal. because it's so prevalent and ingrained in american culture, everyone looks at you funny when you tell them you are trying to quit, you don't get the same compassion/patience as you do with harder drugs.  caffeine really blunted my appetite (so does coke) and i eat more in the morning. but i also don't crash in the afternoon or get insanely tired and reach for sweet food.  i am currently at  coke zero per day, and small - half-caf per week. huge relief in anxiety and it's much easier to organize my thoughts and have better mental clarity.  the hardest part of quitting anything for me is getting through the days you feel exhausted and can't do anything, also truly not believing that some of the withdrawal symptoms are permanent is really, really hard.  the physical exercise shit - which is really exhausting - is probably the most beneficial thing you can do to speed up the process and make your self feel better. when withdrawing from opioids i felt like death, but post workout felt like a king! keeep going",1
"“also truly not believing that some of the withdrawal symptoms are permanent is really, really hard.”  this part. last night was the first night i was able to eat normal food and i’m feeling much better mentally. i actually could hear my “old” energetic self shine through today. but still the tingling and twitching muscles clinging for dear life. “the physical exercise shit - which is really exhausting - is probably the most beneficial thing you can do to speed up the process and make your self feel better.” i’m going to try a ride on the stationary bike or a jog soon. i haven’t tested exercise yet because i was getting winded from walking. i think i’m getting there!",1
"establishing a sleep routine was most helpful for me. in the beginning it was anxiety and panic keeping me awake. when i took steps to take extra care of my anxiety with breathing exercises and meditation, my sleep began to improve. today- here at my  month mark, i still wake up every few hours and use breathing exercises to calm my nerves and get me back to sleep. i personally can no longer sleep past : am. this past week i was waking at  am and had a hard time getting back to sleep. i got a grounding mat about a week and a half ago and it has helped. i use it for around  minutes before bed. i was super skeptical at first but it’s helped me so i don’t care. i notice the difference in my sleep when i didn’t use the mat. *shrug* it’s what’s working for me now.",1
i’m on day ish and sleep has been improving over the last couple of weeks. the first month was rough. woke up in a panic a couple of times like you described. not fun. it gets better though. finally starting to see some improvement around the  month mark.,0
thx for your report! could you please share a little bit more how things developed over time? what withdrawal symptoms did you face? when did it get better? etc,0
i’m at day  and i can also already feel the the reduction in anxiety and stress. i just feel so tired i’m not able to function at work. hopefully it will pass after a few weeks.,1
i noticed similar as well when i quit caffeine. after a few months my body lost this feeling of physical anxiety and tension that i didn't realise was there at all!,0
"this is so great to hear! i'm on day  and already have a noticable decrease in anxiety. my sleep is horrible though, have only managed to get - hours per night the last week. the exhaustion and sleep deprivation is horrible, hope it starts getting better soon.",0
"good you could pinpoint the coffee being the reason for your anxiety. i don't have issues myself with brew coffee, but couldn't tolerate espresso drinks. i'm still on coffee for reducing risk to develop colon cancer which runs in my family.",1
"congrats on the transformation. i'm  days cold turkey off dip and caffeine after  and  years of use respectively. besides the cravings, already feeling a lot more energetic and less anxious. i can't wait to see how close i am to my real self in  months time when i'm fully reset.",1
love it. congrats on the breakthrough. just finished day  and my baseline anxiety has diminished considerably.  it’s interesting how many of the posts here reference a reconnection to the feelings of childhood. i feel that as well. more of a truer connection to myself ,0
"for the first few days i had a headache of course, was sleeping for - hours. then from days - or so i had sudden onset insomnia where i was waking up in the middle of the night and difficulty falling asleep, and a form of anxiety i'd describe as """"helplessness"""". after the first  weeks i noticed my sleep was getting much better though and my anxiety levels were already below my caffeinated state. but from days \~- i had some of the worst apathy imaginable, at one point on one of my free days i couldn't bring myself to do anything, and i paced back and forth for probably  hours. i actually have gone decaf before but couldn't make it past this stage ever. i normally have a strong drive to enjoy myself but the drive wasn't there and i genuinely had no enjoyment doing the things i love, even listening to music lost it's appeal (which has came back thankfully). but towards the end of the th week, onto the nd month the apathy started to lift, all the tension and stress in my body was released and replaced with a constant calm, if i had to describe the feeling it's like i'm on an anti-anxiety drug but i'm just completely sober. music started sounding good again, drive started coming back, etc. also during all of this i had feelings of being bipolar where one moment i'm happy and enjoying my time and then a sudden shift into a bad mental state for hours, for no reason, sometimes i would blame a thought i had but in reality i'm certain at this point it was just withdrawal and my brain would try to blame or catastrophize over a thought. i sufferer from ocd and always thought that it was my thoughts that impacted my mood/mental state, but now i feel it's my mood/mental state (the biology) that impacts my thoughts and how i react to thoughts, with caffeine out of the way i'm much more calm and as a result my thoughts are calm, even thoughts that used to bother me no longer do. i definitely already started feeling much better after the th week though, and currently some anhedonia but nothing like those first few weeks. also intermittent cravings that are getting less frequent.",1
this is really encouraging. i too have ocd. we're told in cbt that it's our thoughts that make us anxious however i believe its not always true. infact often not. it can often be our state physically/chemically that leads our thoughts. i.e if we're consuming a drug which activates fight/flight then we will have anxious thoughts irrespective of how much we try not to. therapists are becoming aware of this now but still some way to go. relax the body heal the mind.,1
thank you for this!!! i’m saving this post and this comment. i’m hoping and praying for caffeine to be the one thing i haven’t tried that might help my anxiety and mood issues just as you describe.,1
"i stopped using nicotine in september of  and it was super challenging. i found myself leaning on coffee to overcome the lack of energy / cravings i had without the nicotine. it got easier over time, so i was able to cut down on my coffee / caffeine intake but still do - cups a day.  i also found a caffeine replacement called paraxanthine that is a natural metabolite of caffeine. after switching to it, i have found i get the same energy without it making me anxious like caffeine. apparently it is processed by your body faster too so you can drink it later in the day. i know they have it in some coffee, and i think there are some energy drinks with it as well. i still want to wean myself off of coffee over time, but using paraxanthine instead of caffeine has made coffee less of an issue for me for now.",1
"i am tapering now and this is tough to read. i was hoping tapering would mitigate insomnia and ahednia from going decaf. did you experience rebound anxiety or an ahednoia since you have been off for several weeks? also, aside from all the other best sleep practices, you might want to try cbd. it has helped me in the past deal with quitting (multiple attempts here)",1
"i did have a few days of anxiety around week , which took me by surprise because i had been experiencing so much less anxiety from tapering and quitting. i definitely experienced anhedonia throughout. it's only just now starting to get better. same with that super sluggish feeling. but it is getting a lot better. i do all the standard sleep hygiene things already, but i will definitely look into cbd. thanks for the suggestion! and good luck!",1
i have the same sleeping problem. hard(er) exercise makes it worse for me. its like the body is fighting to readjust and cant handle more stress. i go for long slow walks instead.,0
anxiety reduction has been the most notable thing for me -weeks in so far.,1
so did you go back? how is your anxiety?,0
i went back to drinking caffeine regularly. my anxiety stayed the same. that's why i wondered if i needed more time to heal or maybe i permanently damaged my sensitivity to caffeine.,1
"i am almost . months as well and still feel raised anxiety, i believe i need more time. had a little less anxiety at  months. a lot of people have a turn point at - months i believe.",1
"sounds like you've been on quite the rollercoaster! it's great that you've managed to cut down to just one cup a day and have noticed positive changes. if you're looking for a way to bridge yourself down to going without coffee entirely, i have used a naturally occurring caffeine metabolite called paraxanthine that might interest you. it provides a similar energy boost to caffeine but without the negative side effects like amplified stress and impacting sleep quite so much. just a suggestion based on my experience. keep up the good work on your caffeine journey!",1
"i have only stopped drinking coffee and then no more tea from midday for the last three days. so i have  cups of tea in the morning, still. i felt less depressed and anxious on day . it's been quite a revelation. i used to drink coffee and tea from waking up till early evening. no mimsy coffee, either, proper strong stuff. i do miss it but i have hyponatremia so can't keep rinsing sodium from my body with caffeine. if you feel no different after three weeks, maybe you don't need to go without it?",1
i feel less anxious/feeling of doom and i have more energy but my sleep is no different. i was hoping i’d start to get more deep sleep.,1
"sure. no anxiety at all. i have a very zen outlook on things. issues that used to upset me seem so trivial now.  i love waking up feeling completely refreshed. i love not “needing” caffeine to just feel normal. being off caffeine has allowed me to listen to my body and respond to its needs. for example if i am sleepy my first thought is no longer, i need caffeine, it’s now, i need to rest (take a nap, rest my eyes, whatever). my sleep is very restful.  i’m sure there’s more which i can’t think of right now but off the top of my head those are the most important.  it’s good to not be addicted to any drugs, including caffeine.   caffeine blocks the adenosine receptors in your brain which are what gives the brain the signal that you need rest. just knowing i’m not screwing around with my brain anymore puts my soul at ease.",1
thank you.  i've just given it up again because i had a panic attack a month ago.  i had one in  and gave it up for  months.  i remember feeling high when i went back on it.  that was when i knew it was a drug!!  i'm still working on my anxiety but at least caffeine isn't exacerbating it now.,1
"decaf coffee still has some caffeine in it, depending on the decaffeination method even a fair chunk, so that can never be going cold turkey. going cold turkey means zero, nada, nothing of a substance at all. tapering can help ease withdrawal symptoms though, so there's that. (although decaf won't have enough caffeine to really ease it much.) herbal teas are nice. ginger tea is great, especially if you cut up some ginger root yourself. a dash of lemon and nice honey can turn that into a real treat and ginger is good for blood circulation.  some of the teecino stuff is good, they definitely all have the right consistency to pass as a coffee substitute, flavours can be meh to delicious.",0
"i quit caffeine  days ago... i'm doing a low-sugar diet. i've been trying for so long to end those sugar cravings but this time, for the last  days, i felt like i really control my appetite.    i don't think it's a coincidence... stress is a survival response to the body and caffeine does stress you out, so i could only guess that so much caffeine will get you on your hunting mode and seek desperately for things (feeling anxious) and that (again i guess) ends up with one eating all the time",1
i don't consume any sugar or sweeteners. so no cravings. very individual. sugar craving is more likely a stress relief.,1
"i've quit caffeine numerous times (from - weeks at a time) and almost always found my sleep improved noticeably. i'm currently a week into my latest detox and i'm having the same issue as you. i'm having a fitness holiday, so stress is about as low as possible aside from a hard workout session each day (morning or pm). i'm prioritising my health and have been winding down when the sun sets around pm. this naturally leads me to be in bed trying to sleep well before pm, but i'm lying awake for a long time. i've tried silence, sleep meditation, music and podcasts but nothing has really resolved it yet.  i am waking up feeling good and not napping during the day, so it could be assumed that my requirement for sleep is being met. but i'm sceptical due to the increased exercise i've been doing, plus past experience where i used to routinely sleep  hours per night even while being a caffeine drinker.  i've been trying all sorts (viewing sunrise and sunset, lots of sunlight during the day also for vitamin d, aforementioned exercise, clean balanced diet, good hydration).  i have been chilling on my bed during the day to escape the heat, so that might be part of it. though i was previously doing the same thing without issue. anyway, good luck!",1
"yeah this is my fear also, if it remained the same for another month or two i’m not sure it would be sustainable for me. although i’m much calmer and less anxious which i think makes it worth still despite the terrible nights and feeling exhausted a lot of the time",0
"yes, you should cut back on your caffeine usage. try to taper off and then see if you can get off it. caffeine makes me jittery, nauseous and anxious ",0
"hehe, welcome to the club, and that doctor is a keeper. mine threw some pills at me while having her morning coffe. she got more and more wired while i talked to her about my one small panic attack that scared the shit out of me. finding caffeine as the culpit i had to do myself.  doctors and a whole team of caffeine addicted mental health workers thought me alot of interesting stuff, but nothing that came even close to helping me with my problem.",1
i was reading about it a little and it seems like caffeine withdrawals can increase anxiety so  maybe don't go cold turkey.,0
"yes. i’ve had a cup of coffee at work before and felt so stressed and kept having the same thought replay on my mind over and over that was making me so anxious and stressed. coffee was way too strong for me, and eventually even tea was. coffee also gave me a very real and terrible shoulder pain that i can’t explain. i think i’m very sensitive to caffeine because even having  cups of tea would send me into stress and anxiety, even one cup of tea would increase my stress and anxiety. so i quit around  months ago.  there’s a good video on youtube by the youtuber ‘what i’ve learned’ called coffee or caffeine, where he goes over how back then they couldn’t tell the difference between an anxiety disorder or someone who was just drinking too much caffeine. edit: the video is called “does coffee make you fat and anxious?” by youtuber ‘what i’ve learned.’",1
this happened to me too and my anxiety has disappeared since quitting coffee. i wrote a post on here about it. well done and feel free to message me if you need any advice !,1
welcome to constantly wondering if your panic attacks were as bad as they seemed because of how much you love coffee.  was it really that bad? sip. im in danger...,1
i always thought i had an anxiety disorder and would have low-key panic attacks a few times a week that coincidentally lined up when caffeine crashes happened after work. turns out it was all caffeine..,1
"so relatable. doctors just don’t get it. my naturopath and chiropractor who specializes in neurology got it. my pcp just presumed i had mental issues and seemed turned off that i didn’t want to take the anxiety medication she gave me after my first panic attack long term. all i was looking for was validation of my symptoms. anyways, they’ve drastically improved- just so disheartened that unless someone has been through it…. they could never imagine.",1
"about the same, i didn't know it could cause panic attacks. and i love coffee a lot but i won't risk my mental health for it.",0
this was my experience also. took my brain about three months to feel like it was turning over correctly and my motivation went in the toilet. quitting alcohol now to work on residual anxiety and experiencing something similar,1
"well, depending on the strength of the teas and added to the coffee that could all add up to be quite a lot of caffeine - especially if some of it is consumed later in the day which might affect your quality of sleep which would have a negative impact on your overall mental health over time.  i mean, there is a middle ground somewhere between consuming a lot of caffeine which may not be helping your anxiety issues and eliminating it altogether, right? personally, if you enjoy drinking tea why not just cut out the coffee and have a couple of cups of tea a day and see how you go with your anxiety?  the trouble with looking up this kind of sub on reddit when you think you have a problem is that .% of the people on here in their little self-reinforcing bubble have just convinced themselves that caffeine is a poison and there’s no one going to advise using common sense before taking a drastic vow of abstinence which may even make your anxiety worsen. i will no doubt get shouted down by various regulars of this sub for suggesting this, which kind of proves my point.",0
i did  months tapering and had very little anxiety and depression.. weed i find i feel pretty emty inside the first -days of not smoking.,0
"i agree with this. you have anxiety? sure we’ll prescribe you an ssri, instead of looking at the cause.",0
"exactly... depression, anxiety, ms, chronic fatigue, colds, flu, asthma, diabetes, arthritis, dementia just as examples, there's no medicinal """"cure"""" for these.   i would argue antibiotics could be classed as a cure, but that's the exception rather than the rule",0
"the lower overall tension while at highway speed is amazing. human brains aren't equipped to be traveling so fast, so our anxiety is already up without us really noticing. when you add chemical stress to the equation it really escalates things. it was the calmest road trip ever. ",0
"i think the negative impacts you observed are dose dependent. honestly, even at the height of my caffeine addiction (consuming mg daily for a  lb person), my basic blood tests were near perfect. the only issue was my sodium was low and this was probably because i drank a bunch of water to stave off heart palpitations. i'd argue the negative impact of caffeine is much more insidious, such as eroding your ability to sleep soundly and increasing any latent tendencies to eat from stress/anxiety. all other negative impacts come from lifestyle factors that may be influenced by caffeine, but not directly caused by it. i'm all for going decaf, but i think we should be honest about the improvements people will experience. i'm at mg daily now down from mg daily and i did not experience any of those benefits you're mentioning, nor do i expect to.",1
"i've thought a lot about this. i'm  months clean from caffeine and i have had anxiety and panic attacks all my life from the age of . what i'm noticing now is that the very high levels of anxiety that i experienced on caffeine have stopped completely, so in general i am a lot more calm all the time. but, i began to notice that i am never really fully calm. there is a more subtle sense of tension that i experience now, almost as if the high levels of anxiety previously distracted me from this and now that things are more quiet i can sense it more clearly.  it seems like my nervous system never really goes full calm. i don't have panic attacks or other regular moments of crisis like i used to. but without a beer or something to depress my nervous system i never feel fully at ease. so i am looking at it like quitting caffeine got me most of the way, and now i have the opportunity to get at the real root of the issue to hopefully move passed this anxiety disorder altogether.",1
"holy shit. so many insanely hard life changes. i'm sure there are an enormous amount of positive changes to come. quitting so many things at the same time has to be extremely taxing, taking into consideration that even one of those lifestyle changes youve made would be a struggle in - month time window.  i wonder if your body wouldnt be going through so many physiological things when quitting so many things at the same time that the anxiety youre feeling now is from the cumulative withdrawal effects from all the substances and habits.",0
"just wanted to say you're doing such good work for yourself! you've changed so many things and that's worth a congratulations. not easy stuff. i also noticed that most of them (except for meditation) are changing external things. which i think is super important and necessary, but sometimes the root of our anxiety or fears is more complex than something we're putting into our body/using.  you say you've always dealt with social anxiety. have you always used weed/alcohol/caffeine/drugs/sugar etc, or did you start most of those things after you already experienced social anxiety? i just wonder if the root might be something deeper, and may require some therapy or something similar to work through. we can do all the things externally to balance our bodies and minds and nervous systems, but if the danger signal is coming from inside the house, all of our external safeguards aren't going to fix the problem.",1
"caffeine makes you release cortisol - it literally makes you anxious, so of course social anxiety will diminish, as it did for me, after quitting caffeine. all the best.",0
- weed free for  months - caffeine free for  days - eat little to no sugars (other than those naturally found in fruits) - alcohol free for  year and  month - exercised moderately for  weeks (i’ve stopped) no improvement to social anxiety. i’m diagnosed with adhd and avpd. undiagnosed depression and anxiety (probably). i don’t take meds. i think we just have to go full-on exposure therapy to fix social anxiety,1
i'm two months into quitting caffeine and have the same issue. i'm less anxious but it always feels like i'm on edge everyday. i started going back to therapy so that i can hopefully uncover the root of it and get into a space of feeling calm and relax for once,1
"i am not a very anxious person, just when it comes to social situations. never really had panick attacks either. when would you say your anxiety got better for you? ",0
"thank you for your kind message! what do you mean exactly by changing external things??   i’ve used stimulants for as long as i can remember. amphetamines for adhd  from  to  years old and then later on caffeine. i suspect that the amphetamines started making me feel anxious ( i had the maximum dosage) and later on caffeine kept me anxious. atleast that is what i hope haha.   i have done several therapies, but it was not of much use, funnily enough they never asked me about my caffeine usage. also i didn’t notice my anxiety get any less with meditation. ",1
"are there any physical changes to your body? like increased heartrate, migraines, anxiety?  i’m interested in taking supplements. i tried fish oil a couple of months ago but i have a bad reaction to it. racing heart, anxiety, jumpiness edit: just read people who are allergic to seafood might be allergic to fish oil. i’m allergic to shrimp 👍",1
"i think  days caffeine free is way too short to conclude anything, i felt absolutely horrible for  months and still feel down. as it goes for exposure therapy, when i was  i actually started doing door to door sales for exactly that purpose, i’ve been in sales for  years. i did public speaking whenever i had the chance. and i’ve been  months sober from alcohol and weed previously were i purposely kept meeting up with friends and going to parties in order to socialise. but it remained hard to socialise and i remained anxious. i have no idea what to do with it.",1
you only notice how much it made anxiety worse when you try a coffee/redbull/etc after a long time,1
"anecdotal, but i take very high dosage of concerta for my adhd (-mg) and the stimulant effect is very mellow and soft compared to even mg caffeine, which is enough to give me anxiety.",1
"yea i had more anxiety, as well as increased heart rate and i also had tingling hands and feet. yea, i’m hoping the supplement helps edit: as for migraines i didn’t get them but i think that’s cause i was also putting electrolytes in my water but before i put electrolytes, if i were to go a day without any caffeine i’d get terrible migraines.",1
"i supppose that experienced level of meditation should solve anxiety problem, im not at that level thou, beer or other alcohol drink does indeed calm me down but relying on it is a bad idea, what i’ve noticed that has immediate calming effect is consuming ice scream or milk chocolate desserts like puddings and stuff.",1
how long did your anxiety lasted?,0
definitely it's a strategy that should be considered if you can manageable it and doesn't want to stress too much your body,0
"reducing already has some beneffits and makes you stop more approcheable. which situtation is better: stop drinknig  cup of coffe /  cigarrete a day or  cups of coffe +  cigs a day? so, imagine if you reduce by  per week of both, in two months you would get to . my point is, reduce its a good strategy to not stress to much our body when cuting things of our lifes",0
"please talk with your health care provider before anything. a lot of people said to not go cold turkey and to gradually ease off caffeine to reduce the withdrawal symptoms. i however went cold turkey because i was bed sick for a week with a bad stomach flu and that was a bad idea on my part as the symptoms hit every way possible. it’s for sure scary thinking about it because sometimes you don’t know what to expect and the unknown can cause a lot of worry and anxiety. for me i just wanted to clean myself from it and start fresh.  in today’s society it’s so widely accepted. people say moderation is key and i agree with that % however most of us don’t consume coffee, sugar, alcohol etc in moderation because it becomes an addiction/daily habit that we feel we need it. for me it was always like once i felt the caffeine/sugar wear off which didn’t seem to last too long i would need my next fix asap and if coffee wasn’t around i’d need to get it from chocolate/sweets and to me that sounds like a nasty habit i needed to kick asap. no different than a drug addict always needing their next fix and caffeine is considered a drug so there’s that.  i think i’ll eventually have another favorite coffee/latte one day but i’ll have to keep it in moderation this time which is the hardest part.  it’s really hard to give up especially when it’s part of your daily routine. i loved to get up early morning and go for a drive, pick up a coffee, listen to music, grab a donut to start my day that was life and it would be totally boring without it. i will say that it definitely took some time getting used to however the new stable energy and overall mood & focus is worth it in my books. but like i said before i think if i go back i will be using it as more of a treat like only on the weekends which maybe i should have tried instead of going cold turkey haha.  oh and also for me i sleep a lot better at night and have better dreams ever since i stopped. i’m pretty sure i have a high sensitivity to caffeine which might not be the same for you. hope this helps my friend.",1
"i take magnesium glycinate. most people are deficient in magnesium. it has muscle relaxing effects, which makes it great for before bed. it also helps a lot with anxiety and stress. a lot of people say it helps them with adhd. your body needs magnesium in order to properly absorb vitamin d.  caffeine consumption can make it difficult to absorb magnesium. since most people are already deficient in magnesium, caffeine addicts are super deprived in many cases.",0
i don’t feel like this at all. i have no sense of deprivation or craving. counting my days gives me a sense of accomplishment and an idea of where i’m at on the roadmap in terms of withdrawal symptoms— a light at the end of the tunnel if you will. there is absolutely no chance of me going back.,0
"didn't change my life. i have ginger tea for that hot morning drink. oh wait, it did. better sleep, no stomach pain and needing antacids, low level anxiety gone.",1
i have constant moderate anxiety from it. and my internals and skin feel like i drank mold and am allergic to it. i also have like depersonalization.,1
"i'm not sure.  doing work now is like playing on hard mode.  especially if the work is monotonous or non engaging.  caffeine just made me tolerate my job, if anything, caffeine makes me tolerate a lot of unhealthy stress.  it's not until you come off and realize, *ah man, this is all really terrible.*  you can either choose to slip back and take another cup, or slowly start working to make positive improvements.  i dunno, i never noticed how bad everything was because being caffeinated i had this attention deficit.  at home i would have all these projects and nothing would get done.  i would just skip over with too many distractions.  it's not until your off the sauce, you can actually focus and prioritize stuff.  yes, everything is still a mess, i'm working on it now.  slowly, but i'm a lot more calm and at home and i just enjoy the calmness of it all.  i can actually read a book now. i'm not sure.  everything seems to be a drag without caffeine.  you just have to find motivations to get through it.",1
"absolutely, in my case. i had debilitating lower back problems years ago. could not stand up for longer periods of time without feeling i could break in half. rolled out of bed carefully to avoid the pain. a week after i stopped caffeine intake in the form of diet-cokes, did the pain go away, along with deep anxiety, depression and suicidal ideations. it has something to do with caffeine affecting the adrenal glands, maybe some one can corroborate or explain in detail. a great book is caffeine blues by cherniske, i believe there are youtube videos of interviews with him. caffeine is a poison, and the rate your body detoxifies varies. i hope that helps.",1
awesome. well i should really take the leap. as an anxious person should have done it a long time ago. these positive stories are inspiring. thank you,1
"sorry for the delayed response.   i quit cold turkey. i mentioned the backaches first because it was the crux of your question, but in reality it was the suicidal thoughts/depression that scared me. if i wasn't a coward, i probably would have followed-through with my thoughts. i remember i would walk the streets hating on myself thinking of how to do myself in or if i should just jump in front of a car. to this day, i don't take other people's depression lightly, i know how real it feels and how hard it is to fight it or rationalize through it. it caused me to question why it was i felt or had these thoughts. there was certainly no outward reason for feeling the depression. i had/have a wonderful family, stable work etc. it lead me to think it was something i was doing that was causing my brain to short-circuit, the only thing i felt i was doing """"too much"""" of was caffeine. at the time, i worked at a company where it was pretty much unlimited sodas and i took advantage. basically  cans of diet-cokes a day, sometimes more sometime less and i would take some home regularly for the weekends. i decided right then and there to quit and within a week, not only did my mental health get better but my backaches improved as well. i hadn't thought that those two issues stemmed from the same cause until then. i didn't learned until later from reading the book i mentioned how far i was damaging my body with chronic stress inducement, among other things. if you are able to drink a small cup a day, that's manageable. i've learned that i am a coffeine alcoholic, or caffeinholic. it doesn't matter whether it's from diet-coke or coffee. i can start with a reasonable small dosage, but it soon loses it's effect (energy, focus, etc), so i need to drink a higher dosage, etc, until it's a enough to damage my body. it's best not to drink it at all.",1
"i agree with this - you might be overtraining op.  i've """"fallen victim"""" to that too several times. you begin chasing that good feeling you get during and after a workout. or you're afraid of not training enough or that you'll lose your strength or other progress somehow. this can lead to another form of addiction. just like one can be a workaholic at the office, so can one be in the gym or on the running track, or in the ice bath or sauna for that matter. the 'trick' or opportunity of quitting caffeine is partly, for some, but maybe primarily for you, to learn how to rest again. to relearn how to care for yourself and enjoy life in the slow phases too, the phases that require you to be happy with the way things are right now. to find that part of you that is a reservoir of patience and joy within itself. that part which doesn't need to be improved or changed, but that part of you from which true change can arise. if you want my suggestion it would be to take a half or full week of all training. observe your sleep quality and patterns throughout the time and embrace that voice urging you to train or cause excessive stress (hormetic or toxic). good luck, friend!  ps. the stress from exercise normally feels quite good, as opposed to stress from caffeine. however, over time the 'good' stress if excessive can also cause symptoms of mental fatigue, depression, anxiety, and insomnia.",0
"i've only tried nicotine, and it's pretty similar to coffee. with any substance, i've never really had """"enough."""" i know it's the same with food, as in you eat every day and still need more, but there isn't the same issue of just never being satisfied like there is with other stimulants. i also noticed one of the reasons that my caffeine use bothers me is because im going through a really stressful time in life, and anything to distract me from the other things going on becomes way too much of a problem, coffee included. things like that have just become a band aid for the things i should be focusing on.",1
"get her a moka pot. it’s a stovetop brewer that’s also something that comes close to espresso that’s very affordable. she then could dilute with hot water to make an americano or add milk for italian drinks or sugar and milk for hispanic drinks. they come in various “cups” that measure about ml per “cup”. so a “-cup” is recommended for one person and a “-cup” is recommended for two people. the name brand for these is going to be bialetti. usually i won’t recommend the name brand cause it’s just a name but as a gift i will. also don’t be alarmed when they say “aluminum pot”, they all are aluminum with some models being stainless steel. there’s also the bialetti brikka that makes an espresso-like foam.",0

"new here, and i write this as a rd generation cofee grower in kenya. so, growing up, the weather patterns were pretty consistent. we had the long rains and right afterwards the mid year harvest around may. there was then the short rains and the major harvest from october to december. we would then prune in jan and feb and the coffee would flower in march april. this was pretty consistent, until it wasnt.   of the last  years were dry years, and our crop was stressed for extended periods. last year, was the only year where we witnessed normal weather patterns, but that has been followed by seriously heavy rains this year which has carried away some of the rich top soil. so, on matters climate, we are witnessing a lot of extreme conditions.  but the conditions notwithstanding, the only reason i would uproot my crop or stop selling is the money. let me set the scene; most growers in kenya are small scale farmers. think of  acre to  acres ( acres is about -hectares). as such individuals do not process their coffee but they form cooperatives for economies of scales. the cooperatives through a wet process depulp, remove the mucillage, dry and then the millers will get the dry patchment from the cooperatives hull to get the green bean and then sell. now, there are only  licensed coffee millers in kenya, which gives them an undue advantage over the farmer. moreover, the farmer is not involved beyond the cooperative level, meaning we are often shafted when it's time to pay.       but there's more, we get our inputs from the cooperative (think fertilizers, pesticides, etc), on credit  for us to pay when we are paid for the coffee (the coffee is paid through cooperatives unless you are a grower marketer). it is a noble cause, but i am in debt even before my crop is ready. there are times when farmers go home with nothing, yet the millers, the marketers, and roasters all make a decent living. couple this with the high demand for land for real etate purposes especially in kiambu, and there's very little to keep farmers in the industry.  now, i am not seeking pity, all i want is to give you a glimpse into the life of a small scale coffee farmer. but with the third generation farmers, we are alive to the fact that we have to find the markets and not rely on third parties for us to make money.",0
"how much fat does coffee at cafes contain? i’m trying to lose weight, but i must have coffee at a cafe every day ✨ i’m usually drinking it without much sugar. but i’m concerned about how much fat does it contain, because i heard that at cafes they add more fat for some reason.  especially the one with milk. it makes no sense to me that i’d have to give up milk if i want to lose weight, because i it’s what nature gives us and what we need. i’m trying to lose weight but not stress out too much about calories, especially in things that nature gives us, we need them and they’re not processed (probably).",0
"the best answer you can get will come from consulting with your doctor. i don't know how much one coffee a week will really impact a person on average, that's pretty little caffeine.  common issues with caffeine are things like anxiety, headaches, increased blood pressure, and impacts on sleeping, so reducing it could help if you're experiencing any of those. again though, any health questions should really go through a medical professional if you want to get meaningful answers.",0
"decaf, for some reason, gives me a worse """"jittery"""" feeling than caffeine. the couple times i had it, resulted in some horrible anxiety. i say caffeine fix because i can only *assume* that is the reason i am so *addicted* to coffee. however it doesn't make sense given a mg energy drink does anything but satisfy my addiction.  so again, what makes coffee so special to the point where people like myself are *addicted* to it? steak is also delicious, but i'm not addicted to it. potato chips are incredibly easy to eat and delicious, but i can go days or weeks without it easy. but i can't go a day without coffee otherwise i'll have such a crazy craving for it the next day that i'd drink like  cups",1
"all-glass?  none come to mind that are built specifically for cold brew, but i’m sure they’re out there.     well, wait… there are some slow drippers that look kinda like a regular pourover but add a vessel for water, and the vessel has a valve that you adjust to drip slowly into the bed of coffee.  the basic idea is, since temperature is a variable for extraction, and hot temperatures extract flavor faster, low temperature needs more time — and a very slow drip is the solution.   this one from hario is pretty cool but it makes me nervous.. lol   this oxo one is plastic (but might be less worrisome since it doesn’t use hot water anyway):    one other popular method around here is, put grounds and water in a jar, mix it, let it sit overnight (or longer), and then pour the mixture through a coffee filter.  or do the same with a french press.   or, like another comment mentioned, there’s “flash brewing”, basically doing a hot brew straight onto ice.  i’ve done this with my moka pot, and it’s fantastic.  for pourovers, look up “japanese iced coffee”.  the idea here is, if you can chill the coffee quickly, it will stop oxidizing so much, and the most aromatic flavors will be “locked in”.  to keep it from tasting diluted, you use enough grounds to work for the total mass of water-plus-ice — so, like at g per liter, you might put g of ice in the pot, and use g of brew water.",0
"hello!  hoping someone can help me with some home coffee recommendations. i have a keurig, and i’ve never liked the coffee it makes— i need to mix in a lot of cream or flavors to make it palatable. even when i do, i really don’t like the aftertaste or the way it makes me feel; it always seems to really upset my stomach. i don’t drink enough coffee to justify spending a ton of money on a machine, but i definitely want something that can brew a better cup. i really don’t know a lot about coffee, i just know that i usually enjoy the taste when i order from a cafe. relatedly, i’ve found that when i get coffee from some places, it makes me anxious, while with others i’m totally fine. this is another reason i really don’t like the keurig. it tends to give me a bad reaction even when i just make half-caf. any idea what that might be about? i read something about some coffee machines “over-extracting” from the grounds, but i’m not totally sure what that means or how to avoid it. would really appreciate any advice. thanks!",1
hello! ive only been drinking  one cup a day for awhile now. i noticed a huge decrease in my anxiety. i was like you- drinking - cups a day and i was very anxious and jittery. i was actually thinking yesterday about reducing it to no cups. i have tried that before but i was really tired. and that’s the only reason i went back to drinking one. the main reason i reduced my caffeine intake was due to anxiety. one you get past the withdrawal and the bad headaches it’s not that bad if you stop drinking it. i did get to that point before and i felt really good with out drinking coffee.,1

"i happened to be on my phone just now, so quick reply time! i haven’t been keeping track this time, but i am -. weeks deep. definitely better than my last attempt, largely because there wasn’t much of a withdrawal. i’m so glad i’m not sucking down coffees to try and feel better. the anxiety decrease is real. as is the sleep enhancement. i’ve still had the occasional decaf and the odd granola bar and ice cream with chocolate in it, so i’m technically not totally caffeine free, but i was doing + coffees a day before, so the change is stark enough. i was an angry, moody bastard on coffee, because of the headaches (which have disappeared!). it’s obvious now that the headaches were just due to withdrawal and being in-between fixes. i still have the occasional day of body and neck pain, but i’m fairly early in this thing and there are other factors that contribute to that shit.",1
i gave up caffeine about a week ago and just realized today that my anxiety is much better!!,1
i have a severe addiction and gone cold turkey myself too. its really difficult and im constantly dealing with my mind playing me games especially focused on health anxiety. today is day . wish me luck and stay strong!,1
"wean off caffeine slowly over the course of a few weeks. i was a longtime heavy caffeine drinker (over mg minimum per day) and i quit cold turkey. that was a mistake! my withdrawal symptoms were severe. worse than any website like webmd, etc., describes withdrawal symptoms. i had severe migraines, neck pain, brain fog, back pain, burning sensations, and anxiety for almost a month. i never had those symptoms before. i honestly thought i had brain cancer, or some other nervous system disorder. it was terrible and adversely affected work, parenting, and school. i stuck with it and have not had caffeine in months. i feel a lot better now and i don't rely on caffeine to feel normal. i sleep well and feel rested. i have more consistent energy throughout the day instead of having up and down spikes depending on when i get my fix. after comparing how i felt on caffeine and how i feel now, i can definitely say that heavy caffeine use is not healthy. try cutting your intake by % each week over the course of a few weeks. trade out caffeinated drinks with something else such as gatorade zero, or light lemonade, etc. drink lots of water as it will help flush your system and keep you hydrated. good luck!",1
"it was terrible but as they say, when you’re going through hell, keep walking.  my headache lasted a couple days, then i felt really down and anxious for like a week.  then i came out of it and feel great now.  also i had really terrible insomnia the first week or so without caffeine.  it felt like there was a cloud just lingering right in front of my head behind my eyes and i never got really sleepy at night.",1
i’m finishing day . detox started because i got the flu and then all those symptoms were amplified because of caffeine withdrawal. i’m still dealing with headaches late in the day but the two worst ones are anxiety and insomnia. this post comes to you after two hours of being unable to fall back to sleep at am. i’ve just tossed and turned because i couldn’t turn my brain off. i was a - cup a day coffee drinker.,1
"yes. i am  / months off the bean and it still gets me down sometimes even though my life is x better.  for me the first three days were pain, the next few were depression, a few weeks of lethargy and then about two months of anxiety and waking up in the middle of the night. i felt so much better after month three and month  is even better. caffeine is a serious brain and mood altering drug and it takes a long time to rewire. it is, however, worth quitting. hang in there.",1
"caffeine makes me feel really bad but i can't help it! i'm a real addict. i get intestinal cramps and fast heart rate, i suffer from anxiety and it easily makes me anxious but i cannot function without it and the smell and taste make me feel so good i can't resist not having coffee.",1
i am caffeine free for a week and feel normal today. last week was weird. i felt tired and anxious. now i feel normal again.,1
"i get worse depression and anxiety every time i try to quit than the caffeine itself ever gave me.  it’s weird that it causes anxiety, but also withdrawing causes crazy depression and anxiety for me",1
that’s normal when you cut out stimulants. your body convinces itself that you need what you were addicted to and it gets anxiety if it doesn’t get just that.  just breathe and wait it out. you got this.,0
thank you so it’s been very hard to deal with this and i’m staying positive but sometime this anxiety get the best of me.,0
"yeah it gets bad for a bit but then your anxiety will be tons better, i promise!",0
"this not a forever thing is it because i had a panic attack march th due to me being irresponsible with my caffeine intake i would take two scoops of pre-workout for the gym than when i came home i’m a gamer so i would order starbucks twice during the day. but since that day i’ve had these problems with sleeping, thinking, driving,etc. does this anxiety go away? or am i stuck with this forever?",1
that's great ☺️ i'm on day  caffeine free. did you notice any delayed changes or withdrawal symptoms that happened beyond the first couple of weeks? i am kind of curious if this is as good as i can expect to feel or if it gets better.,1
can you describe how your anxiety feels different when you’re off caffeine? mine is so ever-present i can’t imagine how it would feel if it were gone/lessened. but i probably (definitely?) make it worse with way too much caffeine.,1
"eh, i’d say you feel the most obvious effects within the first month. after the month mark you start to get sleepy easier and you also get kinda animalistic instincts to drink coffee/soda when you smell it or are around it. (near coffee shops or at the movies for example) i miss caffeine all the time but my anxiety is the one thing preventing me from partaking, or i’d have a really small intake. you more miss the novelty of the taste and feeling association that’s physiological than the actual caffeine itself or the drink itself, if that makes sense.",1
"caffeine makes a big difference in my muscle tension. i feel the difference on a physical level...posturally and in my breathing patterns (less chest breathing, more diaphragm breathing) and less aches and pains related to muscle tension that flared up when i used to feel more anxious and more guarded.  caffeine in a hormonal way puts us in """"fight or flight"""" mode more often, and that comes with more chest breathing and more muscle tension in dozens of neck/torso muscles involved in chest breathing. those muscles make a difference for stuff like headaches, back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain. i know that's not super scientific but that's what the difference feels like to me....less muscle tension in my chest-breathing muscles, and less of the aches and pains that result from tension in those muscles.  less frequent self-care massage to fix the tension because tension isn't accumulating as fast as it did before.",1
even just slowly lowering caffeine helped mine tremendously. what would set off an instant panic for me with caffeine just jumps my heart rate a little without caffeine. i’m able to logically dissect the situation and act accordingly rather than having my adrenal glands pour themselves out at the smallest inconvenience and have me popping a xanax to chill out. it’s absolutely night and day difference. add in the fact that i walk/ walk at a brisk pace about - miles a week and i feel great by comparison.,1
you quit around the same time as me last week i quit cold turkey...i'm on day  caffeine free ☺️☺️☺️ the week before that i wanted to quit cold turkey but only made it about  hours....had a very emotional day  and decided to re-attempt it at a less stressful time.  last week turned out much better ☺️. however the headache from my st failed attempt was about x worse than the headache i got when i tried it again the next week so maybe that st attempt was useful even though it didn't stick. how are you feeling so far?,1
"the last week i’ve been slowly tapering off, and a few nights it took me for ever to fall asleep despite being dead tired. this time last year i was probably drinking about , and i’ve slowly (although not steadily) cut it down to what it was before quitting. i didn’t experience brain fog, i just felt absolutely like i had zero energy and i was in so much physical pain i couldn’t open my eyes or even move. so i guess i never had brain fog because i stopped so abruptly that it all hit me like a truck.  i go through periods of drinking heavily, i was drinking probably - mixed drinks per night for the past two months. i’m not feeling super bad from that, but ever since i went vegan my hangovers have almost gone away completely so i think that is part of it.  i hope you are on the upswing as well, i never thought i would feel this awful from quitting. thankfully today headache has been a background noise at most. looking online and the time frame about five days seems to be in the middle or very end of withdrawal symptoms, hopefully you are nearing the end.

"what is your concept of """"normal""""?  if it includes that hyped up anxious feeling you get from caffeine, then you won't get that by staying off caffeine. seems to me your brain and nerves gradually recover from caffeine over months to years.  i suppose it's possible that some effects are permanent.  would be hard to know. whenever i'm tempted and try caffeine again, it is a wonderful rush for a few hours.  but i'm suspicious about it, i don't think it actually helps me get stuff done.  it's more like """"monkey mind"""", not very focused.  and then i'm tired but i can't rest effectively.  and my sleep is just awful -- very shallow.  so next morning i'm wiped out and want caffeine even more. here is a relevant section from a [recent interview on fresh air]( >people take drugs because they think it make - the drugs make them feel good. but as you point out, if you're taking an addictive drug, after a while, the drugs just kind of make you feel normal. they don't get you high anymore. but if you stop using the drug, you feel sick. you feel - you're in pain. you feel really terrible. >so there's a neurological explanation for that. and you say that has to do with the fact that the brain is always trying to bring you into a state of homeostasis, into a state of stability. so the brain compensates for things that are unusual that are going on. so how does that figure into addiction? >grisel: yeah. the brain compensates for regular unusual things, you could say. so the more you take a drug to change the way you feel, the more your brain produces the exact opposite state. and it does that so that you're at this stable, homeostatic baseline. and you can tell if something important is happening. so i drink coffee every morning. i wouldn't think of not drinking it. and when i wake up, i don't really wake up. i'm - i am - drag myself out of bed, straight to the coffee pot. >before i talk to my family or my pets, i'm making the coffee because i don't feel awake and then enhanced by the coffee. i feel lethargic because my brain knows that coffee is coming and that when the coffee arrives, now i feel normal. and it's the case for every single drug. if you take a drug to feel awake, you'll produce lethargy. if you take a drug to feel relaxed, you'll produce anxiety and tension. if... >gross: you'll produce that when you don't have the drug. >grisel: right. yeah. and so - or even as you take the drug so that it doesn't really work so well. so that makes you tolerant to the drug. so someone who's a naive user will get a big experience of the drug. but a regular user just feels about normal. >gross: and does that figure into why it's so hard to give up the drug? >grisel: absolutely, because without the drug, then you feel less than normal. you have this adapted brain state that will only feel normal when the drug is delivered. so your craving is focused specifically on getting back to the normal state. so the - it's really - you know, what once was a luxury or felt especially wonderful now just makes you feel ok. >gross: now, does that explain, for instance, if you take a drug to help you sleep because you have trouble sleeping, when you stop taking the drug, your insomnia is way worse than it was before you'd started taking it? >grisel: absolutely, exactly that. yes. and so many people take drugs to help them sleep not realizing that those drugs are making them not able to sleep in the long run. so you have to have the drug.

i agree. cold turkey is miserable. i've been caffiene free for  months now.  and drank since i was . staple of my day. i used a product called wean caffeine from weancaffeine.com i highly recommend to anyone trying to quit. its pills that reduce the amount you take by mg every  days over  days. makes is so easy to taper your use. when i tried cold turkey i had horrible headaches and severe fatigue along with nausea. i don't think i could have quit without it and had very few withdrawal symptoms. ,1
"i've bought caffeine detox products from from amazon and i think they are bullshit. herbs aren't going to give your liver an edge. your liver already is kicking ass to detox your body. you don't need them. what i recommend is the wean caffeine supplement. i've tried forever to quit too bc i work night shift and my caffeine habit was keeping me up after work and making my anxiety and migraines worse.  i  was going to quit cold turkey  with the products available on amazon but after researching the active ingredients, i believe the main ingredient is retacarpine or something spelled similar to that. in the research i did on the herb, it seemed to work in rats  but  has not been studied in humans hardly at all. i chose not to take it because i take blood pressure medication and if it truly worked as the company say it does, it would remove the caffeine along with other medications in your system. today is my first day caffeine free actually. i've tried everything to quit from cold turkey to tapering my dose down by / can of pepsi(my preferred beverage lol) a day. it didn't work for me. i've also tried the wean caffeine supplement three times over about  months of taking multiple wean caffeine pills per day over multiple failed attempts to quit. i finally said screw it and ordered another single pack of the wean caffeine supplement and only took it once a day before work. it was a rough thirty days and i was tired much of the time but i did it. i hope it helps. best of luck to you :)",1

may the force be with you! i’m starting over tomorrow after relapsing. i made it  days after  years serious caffeine addiction. time in the struggle varies a lot. there is a book called caffeine blues that has good info on how to taper off and supplements that help with withdrawals.  i would say it takes - days to get past the acute withdrawal symptoms.  i suggest checking out r/decaf as there are a lot more followers there. best of luck!! ,1
"zero caffeine.  you can't moderate.  release yourself, stop fighting with it and just give in to what you know you need to go.  it's easier than constantly fighting it.   the dex is also bad for anxiety.  ",0
"yeah, i can't moderate, but quitting cold turkey makes it nearly impossible to do anything and last time i quit cold turkey i was still in withdrawal on day  when i gave in and who knows how much longer that would have lasted and that was only possible cause i was on vacation. i sleep constantly, can't work, seriously.  i'm a teacher and i can't write lesson plans or go to work or workout or do anything on zero caffeine or even  or  cups.  i want to be off it, but i can't do it cold turkey, and a strict taper usually fails, so again, i feel the """"just drink as little as possible each day"""" and record it works best.  sure, the dex can be bad for anxiety, but i don't want to be using that every day either, and since it has helped in the past with quitting coffee, and believe it or not, i find it to be less physically addictive, if it can help i'll use it.i have no idea of what else to try other than assuming that if i keep working at it sooner or later i should be successful, but even once i break the dependence i have to be able to stay off it which is also hard.",1
"i appreciate what you are saying, but saying someone should quit cold turkey and actually being that person and managing to work a job and function and get things done while in an extreme state of lethargy are something entirely different.  last time i tried cold turkey i went  days and my wd was just as strong as on day  and i gave in.  the point isn't about wanting to moderate or manage it.  i don't.  i do want to quit.  it's a matter of how to get there that is the point.  yes, i will take as little klonopin as possible, but i get social anxiety when i teach and do other things if i have none.  the point is how to get to the point of being off caffeine, and cold turkey taper is too brutal unless i have nothing to do, but tapers are just so slow i feel i'm getting nowhere.  the best i ever seem to do is say something like """"less than  cups a day and if i mess up see each day as a new day.""""   i see no possibility of managing to live my life while quitting cold turkey.  if it were  or  days, fine, but + without knowing when it will end while working? i don't see how.",1

"excess of water, start working out. specifically intense cardio helps give you energy boosts. look into hiit training or just doing  mins a day -x a week running or doing a workout class. if you’re not a big gym person, even just an hour of walking daily can help. finally diet is huge. most of us don’t get properly nourished by the foods we eat. start looking into adding more nutrient rich foods, plant based meals and certain supplements to help give you natural energy. the  day detox diet can be a good resource to use, but there are many other books that also sum up how to gain energy from good nutrition  also, i’d highly advice not trying to quit anything else when quitting caffeine. once caffeine is gone, it takes a bit to naturally build up your energy, and even though the most intense of the withdrawal symptoms pass relatively quickly, the fatigue can go on for much longer.  having a compelling reason to quit and making yourself read the negative long term side effects to develop that reason could also help with the mental side of it too!

"caffeine causes symptoms of anxiety and panic. if you don’t have a tolerance for caffeine and then you take a huge dose (a starbucks coffee, a pain reliever with caffeine in it, another coffee, and tea that often has caffeine in it) you can basically cause your body to sort of “over dose” on it, because your body can no longer tolerate what you were once able to handle.  so the symptoms you’re experiencing are panic symptoms induced by caffeine “over dose” and intolerance. the lasting symptoms could be something as simple as your body burning through caffeine stored in your fat cells (a similar thing happens with drugs like thc, where you can experience a ghost high days or weeks later when your body begins to metabolize the thc stored in your fat cells), or the panic of you thinking you’ll experience more symptoms causing you to have panic attacks.  some people say that the biggest cause of panic attacks is the fear that you’ll experience another one in the weeks after your first one.  so, basically—relax. don’t drink caffeine, be thankful your body is intolerant and no longer craving it, and try to drink plenty of water to help flush it out of your system.

"dude! i’m not an exaggerator. i’ve been to the doctor  times. you may have a different tolerance for things, but you seem to have a history of being very dismissive of caffeine withdrawal.  it wouldn’t take a genius to figure this thing out. caffeine is the only common denominator. period. i’ve had several blood test, chest x rays, echocardiogram, stress test and all. everything comes back fine i don’t drink. i don’t smoke. i don’t even eat chocolate or coffee. i don’t engage in crazy things. i study. the only thing i do is workout. used supplemental caffeine (preworkout).  it’s not just coffee. ask questions, but don’t be dismissive of people’s experiences man. people turn to this for affirmation that they’re not alone and that other people are going through the same thing. just because you’ve never experienced it, doesn’t mean others aren’t.  i know what a caffeine headache is when originally quitting. that’s just from sodas. this wasn’t just a soda, coffee, or tea. it was something much larger.

"why?  because i've done it before and everyone reacts differently to these things and here's how it was last time: flu-like symptoms (minus fever or vomiting of course), massive lethargy so that i couldn't do barely anything, depression, mood swings, and on day twelve it was still just as bad as day  and i had no idea when it would end.  i used to do cold turkey and it didn't last as long for some reason, but i have no reason to believe it won't be like that again, and while i do have some time off from work for the holidays, i don't have twelve days and i can't work feeling like that or really do much of anything.  if i just have at least like  cups i can probably manage to do some stuff.  plus, i take klonopin which makes me tired and that probably makes it harder for me to abstain from caffeine than you because the caffeine balances it out so i'm not so tired from it, but it also makes me more anxious so i need more klonopin so if i can manage to drink less coffee i'll need less klonopin and that will be good.  you can't expect everyone will react the same way to substances or withdrawal as you do because people have different biochemistry.  on the other hand, cutting down slowly is no good either.  what i can do is just drink as little as possible.  that won't really prolong the suffering so badly.",1

"i never had panic attacks while quitting, but i did experience a similar counter-intuitive kind of thing. a couple of weeks out i had a night or two when i would all of the sudden become super awake right before bedtime and basically not be able to sleep. no real anxiety, thankfully. that seemed really odd to me because a) i was expecting that the withdrawals would just make me tired, not that they would ever make me more awake, and b) being about  weeks out i kinda thought i was past the point of having any extreme symptoms. i also thought it was odd because i'd quit a couple of times before and had never experienced this, and in fact this time i did a more gradual taper than before so i expected it to be more smooth. i did some reading and come to the conclusion that the brain chemicals returning to homeostasis simply might not be as linear of a process as you'd think. in my case the culprit was probably caffeine's effect on adenosine and melatonin. but if something similar happened with, say adrenaline, cortisol or serotonin (which caffeine also greatly affect), i could see that resulting in a seemingly counter-intuitive panic attack. the good news is that the longer i've abstained from caffeine, the more things have smoothed out and i feel much better in every way now that i'm over  months free of the stuff. being caffeine free has helped my anxiety more than i could ever tell you. a couple of disclaimers should be added. i'm not an expert and my armchair nuerochemical speculation shouldn't be seen as anything more than that. also, i think whenever things like this happen it is important to be open to the possibility that it's a coincidence and doesn't actually have anything to do with caffeine at all. there could be a more serious underlying medical cause going on. it might be smart to talk to your doctor, particularly if it happens again. anyway, good luck!",1

"hi, i'm on a similar journey to you--i cut alcohol and caffeine out cold turkey maybe about  days ago. somehow, without even meaning too, i've tapered down my sugar quite a bit as well and have been eating quite healthy. i still don't feel great. we have been poisoning our bodies for years, so it makes since that even after over  weeks i have bouts of fatigue/anxiety/depression. my whole diet has changed drastically, and although it's healthier, it is used to having instant energy instead of breaking down healthy energy over a longer period of time. after about a week and a half the severe withdrawal symptoms go away. mine were pretty bad including severe lower back pain, so it may be that my withdrawal will last longer. i have read of it taking months to feel completely normal, especially if, like me, you drank tons of caffeine for most of your adult life. any suffering you feel is your body rewiring itself to understand and nourish itself with healthy food/lifestyle. and then, i believe your mind needs to do the same, as it is no longer filled to the brim with racing caffeine filled thoughts, and has to work harder to find it's true source of energy/creativity. i wake up easily and only need about  hours of sleep now (used to need -). i've lost weight at a rapid pace, after i quit sugar. but i have very anxious thoughts, feel unmotivated, and generally lethargic. again, i've read that could last up to  months depending on how long/how much you were drinking. i welcome it, to be honest, instead of the almost manic highs i was getting from drinking - cups of coffee a day. in fact, i accidentally drank caffeine--didn't realize it was in kombucha--about  weeks in and it was awful. after an eighth of the bottle i knew it had caffeine, i couldn't stop talking and my whole body was tense and almost twitching. it's weird that we grow to rely on that feeling to be productive.  i relate to you having those flashbacks. i had them for a bit too. i feel as if i'm almost going through a second wave of withdrawal right now, craving it all the time and feeling really, really tired--but i think that once this is lifted life will be reminiscent of childhood, where our energy was natural and fresh.  keep hanging in there.",1

"what works for me every time i quit (yikes. several times, for months at a time, then something happens and i snowball again) so take a day or two and drink normally, but count your cups. figure out your body's intake in milligrams, whatever makes you feel leveled. now buy a pack or two of  hour energy. do the math of that and ration that out so you meet the mg per day you were drinking in coffee, and every couple days reduce the amount by a bottle.  it takes me about  weeks to ween off. i've tried going cold turkey but that results in hardcore rebound.  you'll get a little withdrawal, probably general sluggishness,or mild headache. still way better than the fucked up brain grinding pain and nervous restlessness going cold turkey though.  remember if you """"relapse"""" you basically have to start the process over, not worth it, not worth a rollercoaster.  edit: also, find yourself a habit doll(i just made it up, don't google it) like a voodoo doll per sey that you use to escape an urge. you'll probably feel an urge to go buy an energy drink or dutch bros after work if you skipped coffee. the doll will be what you replace that with, put the pins in the doll. i use gatorade. (smokers use toothpicks) i still get the satisfaction of walking out of the store with something in my hand, and it's not caffeinated and that feels good. ",1
"i think it just depends on how much self-control you have for staying the course.  weaning off may lessen the withdrawal effects, but also makes it easier to tell yourself that it's ok to have just a little bit more today and throw off your whole back-off plan.    i weaned off over the course of about  weeks by first only allowing myself a cup for a week, then a half cup, then a quarter cup, then nothing.   however, i did this mostly over xmas vacation where i didn't have stress from work, could sleep extra long, etc.   it was still really hard with plenty of headaches and grumpy days.  even at  weeks with no caffeine i'm finally starting to feel like i might get back to my normal alertness. i definitely would wait until you are really solid in your quitting of smoking before attempting to quit caffeine, particularly since they are both so wrapped up in feeling alert.",1
"dude, that's not caffeine withdrawal, it's the opposite in fact.  you've reintroduced a stimulant into your system after greatly reducing your tolerance to it, of course it's going to hit you hard.  when i was hooked to caffeine, i could drink cup after cup of coffee, but now if i have even half a cup of tea, i am off the walls with jittery energy which morphs into anxiety & sleeplessness.  i wouldn't worry about it, now you know what happens when you reintroduce caffeine into your body until a tolerance is built up.",1
"i've recently given up coffee and i'm slowly trying to rid myself of sugars as well. im about  weeks in. i gave in one day and got a decaf coffee, and a few days i got tea in the morning. when i'm struggling really hard with cravings i grab a nutriment  (the egg nog flavor is the bomb) which does have high sugar in it but i follow it up with a work out and justify it as a pre work out drink. haha. it's been hard, my job is a  hour on call type of gig so caffeine was a huge help, buy my anxiety has been crippling lately so it needs to go. i definitely agree with fruits replacing sugar cravings, as well. im not a water person, personally, so i drink flavored selzters and diluted powerades. slowly but surely i'm getting there. i'd rather feel groggy and have a head ache than have heart palpitations so most of the time it's a no-brainer to not get coffee.",1
"tulsi tea by organic india is delicious and helps your body deal with stress. it actually is supposed to help heal the adrenals verses wear the, down. i feel like we just need something warm tod rink often. also people who drink coffee to self medicare like the dopamine effect. i would suggest this for either reason.",0
"thank you, i will give it a try. on vacation now and. tweekig out on coffee to deal with the time change. pretty stressed.",1
but i've been on the ssri for more than a year and hadn't had any of this before. i'm also still anxious and periodically panicky.,0
"look up the linden method. works wonders! i drank way too much caffeine while doing it at first though. doing the method now when on no caffeine again and i feel awesome. what he teaches is the only solution to anxiety disorders. ssri's doesn't help, neither does work. and i have been on them myself too a couple of years ago. do you exercise by the way? if not, i would start doing it. caffeine is not the way to go. the temptation is great to go back, i know, but if you think about it, was the body designed to only be happy while in a stressed, stimulant state? i can guarantee you it was not. the reason people get happy by caffeine is because it's an addiction. caffeine makes you feel like shit when you withdraw from it, which is why the first coffee of the day is the best, since it's the longest time you have gone without caffeine.  i felt like shit on ssri's, and didn't feel them helping at all. ssri's are against clinical depression; when you have a lowered level of serotonin in the brain. anxiety is not about some chemistry in the brain being off, it's simply a subconcious habit which feeds itself on a loop (fear causes fear causes symptoms causes fear). it's just about breaking that habit to make the amygdala reset itself in the brain from anxious, to non-anxious.",1
"hello, bookwench! thank you very much! haha, yeah, i'm surprised this group is not bigger than it is. what is it, like % of the worlds population drinking caffeine on a daily basis? with the increased number people suffering from psychological problems, burn outs, stress, anxiety, depression etc., i'm extremely surprised that caffeine is not brought up more. after researching the crap out of caffeine, and reading the caffeine blues book, i am absolutely certain it is a dangerous drug. not in the short run, but for sure in the long run. sure, consuming  mg's of caffeine a day is probably not that big of a problem, but you're probably better off it; plus - who consumes  mg of caffeine a day? what is interesting also is that all the research on caffeine and negative effects uses people who is not under stress. or they make up a conclusion, saying """"for regular people,  mg or less per day poses no health risk what so ever"""", pointing to a pretty much non-existant, perfectly healthy, completely stress-free, young individual. caffeine is bad, and i know this from hearing complaints from all kinds of different people who is gulping multiple mugs of the stuff per day.  i will see if i can find your proposed alternatives. i live in europe though, so i think sadly it'll be a costly adventure getting some celestial seasonings here. :)",0
"yeah, it's absolutely crazy. i remember my first cup so vividly. i was out on a boat trip with my family, and my mother and father had brought a thermos with black, super strong coffee together with some cookies. i asked if i could have some because i guess i wanted to feel like a grown up. it tasted pretty bad, but after that, i kept drinking it. i liked how it tasted with milk as well, and is how i have been drinking my coffee since. yeah, i agree. it's kind of like smoking cigarettes as well. i don't know how many can honestly say that their first cigarette tasted good, or any cigarette they smoke for that matter. but, because you get an extremely fast nicotine kick and get relieved the withdrawal symptoms, a cigarette """"tastes good"""" because you associate that flavor with a good feeling. i think allen carr mentioned this in his book; if something tasted like socks, and still had this effect, we could grow to enjoy it when we are addicted. scary stuff. i tried decaf btw, but it only wants me to drink regular coffee. i will have decaf if i get a crazy desire to have a real one though.",0
"you're right about the op's headache being a caffeine withdrawal headache, but your description of the mechanism isn't right. yes, adenosine triphosphate (atp) is the """"energy"""" storage chemical. but atp and it's base unit, adenosine, also function as neurotransmitter chemicals that can cause pain. adenosine causes the head pain of caffeine withdrawal headache. adrenaline, now called epinephrine, is a different chemical. caffeine blocks adenosine receptors, so the nervous system adapts to adenosine by becoming more sensitive to adenosine. when caffeine is abruptly withdrawn, the adenosine system, adapted to caffeine, malfunctions absent caffeine, and too much adenosine is released, which causes the headache. when quitting caffeine you can avoid the withdrawal symptoms including headache by gradually decreasing caffeine intake. that will give your nervous system time to re-adjust to life without caffeine without malfunctioning.",0
"i wasn't addicted in the first place. i was just dependant on it and it was habitual. i quit caffeine first time trying. i had bad withdrawals and shitty emotions for a few weeks, but i'm feeling great now. i also hold my cold shower responsible for my great feelings afterwards. i suggest you look up the benefits if you haven't. the green tea was responsible for maintaining energy without crashes and the theanine content in the tea helped with social anxiety... which i have quite frequently. i don't know what your relationship with caffeine is like, but i think you're demonizing it too much. now marijuana is a drug just like alcohol, but it doesn't make it bad. cannabis is nothing, but good and has never killed anyone. the only thing bad you could say about it is when people smoke it. of course, any smoke going into your lungs isn't a good thing, but that's not the drug causing it. same with caffeine. you can't compare caffeine to alcohol... a drug that can kill you or cause severe brain damage if taken in its pure form. there's many health benefits with green tea and it's shown that caffeine doesn't really have terrible negative effects with a full healthy individual unless it's abused. hell, i don't consider my years of drinking caffeine as bad, i didn't consume more than mg a day and my current energy doesn't seem any more than when i was drinking it daily. so going forward into the future, i will be consuming green tea some days, but most days i'll remain caffeine free as i have been mostly these past - months. i will be trying theanine though, proven to be a great amino acid found in green tea. i also wont be consuming  green teas, if i was to consume green tea in the future, it would be just one cup along with mg of theanine",1
"thanks for the magnesium tip. well i got the flu, so i got that going for me. it did actually help to overshadow the caffeine withdrawal symptoms, making it easier to continue. now i'm in my second week, i still feel a lot of fatigue. but the anxiety has disappeared, i still sleep like crap, but i think that's because i have somewhat of an hormonal problem. the whole transition from drinking coffee to not drinking was surprisingly smooth. i still miss the comforting quality of it, but after substituting it with hot cocoa, which isn't that addictive at all, it was easy to let go of the whole hot drink comfort habit. i still have herbal teas and my occasional hot cocoa, but not as frequent as coffee.",1
"yeah exactly. people aren't aware how dependent they are on caffeine. i was talking to one of my coworkers and he said that he couldn't stop drinking coffee because he had a lot of work and projects. even though, we know that caffeine, when addicted, only stops the withdrawals symptoms and it's not a real boost. i've been without caffeine for a month now. now even the caffeine in a hot cocoa keeps me awake. it's crazy. i feel less anxious and mentally i feel the same as when i drank my morning coffee.  ",1
"hmm... i had quite the contrary effects. caffeine did make my anxiety worse when i did not have it... but i was always a lot more social when drinking a lot of coffee/energy drinks. the average may be below where i'm at, but the highs are still the highs for me...",1
i was super social when i first started drinking coffee but recently i started getting panic attacks ,0
"this is a great idea. i drink only half caff coffee now and am using that to finally get off of caffeine. one of my flaws is i like to """"treat"""" myself after a big accomplishment with an energy drink or starbucks or whatever. i ended up getting a large mocha frappucino with  shots of espresso in it and downing it with a rockstar. holy shit was that the worst day of my life.  i felt amazing for about an hour, and then pissed the fuck off all day. (i'm normally a chill, quiet guy by the way). my entire body was just filled with aggressive energy and i could just not calm down. i was raging all day at work, trying so hard not to scream at everyone. every little thing just pissed me the fuck off. ended up bitching out my best friend because he was suppose to pick me up off after work and his phone was on silent, so he ended up not calling me back for about  minutes and i had to walk  miles to get home. in retrospect, yeah my day would've still had the same annoyances. there were plenty of legitimate things that didn't go well, and i think anyone else would've felt annoyed as well. but rage level anger bordering on psychosis? no way. that actually scared me. i can safely say i will never by another starbucks, or any other drink that has super ultra mega energy type bullshit in it. so yeah, definitely go for it. you'll be shocked, like """"holy shit! this is what it's doing to me?"""" go out and chug some energy drinks or get a huge ass coffee with everything in it and don't stop until you start getting those heart palpitations, panic attacks, spazzing out, etc. sure it's a bit extreme, but it'll scare the shit out of you and show you just how not in control you are.

"why would you want to increase dopamine? usually, people want to get rid of it, because it causes addiction... if you want to increase it - get some sugar... :) p. s.  days in here... not a single day do i think that i should get caffeine. all that tea bullshit is bullshit. it's just tea, not some sort of magic - it still contains caffeine and the effects are relatively small. really.. i had the toughest exams of my life and they went just fine. if you want to increase your productivity - take  g of vitamin c. it helps to perform under stressful situations and is not addictive.",0
"yeah it happens. part of withdrawals. the body is in a state of panic and its sending messages however it can.  in two more weeks it will be gone and your only nightmares will be about drinking coffee thinking you ruined your streak. don't cave in, you will only have to go through this again",0

i am a little over  days completely off caffeine now. i am feeling great and it gets better and better! sleep is good and deep. steady energy throughout the day. sometimes i think about cafés and the coffee sipping... but those thoughts and feels are slowly starting to pale. i am feeling good about the quitting mostly - i haven't had any anxiety or panic attack since then. no nervously agitated feelings for no reason! ,1
be cool! that was an accident and mg will not change dramatically your central nervous system rebalancing process - since you'll not ingest caffeine any more and you'll not disturb your rebalance process again.,0
"mg is super tiny, barely a drop in the bucket. don't stress too much about it, prob won't reset your withdrawal process. sounds like you've been doing awesome, so just keep at it. and thanks for the heads up on that brand.",0
"don't worry, that happened to me about a week ago when i was at week  of being caffeine free. you can check my post about being careful with sneaky sources of caffeine. i just had about  or  days of mild withdrawal symptoms. nothing as severe as the first week. my withdrawal symptoms are also lingering for quite a while. it took until a bit after  weeks for them to be finally mostly gone. now i only have the expected symptoms at this stage: run out of energy by the end of the day and sometimes very light headaches. it's supposed to take about  months for those symptoms to go away and finally reach % potential. nonetheless, i already feel way better than before quitting caffeine.",1

"thank you for the kind words of support. i've already informed my primary physician. she told me she herself quit caffeine a few years ago. she told me that although  week is usually the worst, that it actually takes  weeks for the body to completely cleanse itself. she also said then it takes another  days for the body to adjust to not getting caffeine and to expect withdrawal symptoms to still linger for that long. the thing is that there's so little information out there that sometimes it is hard to tell when a symptom is due to the caffeine withdrawal or something else. in my case, it is looking like the herbal teas were exacerbating the nausea symptom.",1

"yes, i did. i mean the withdrawal symptoms from quitting white tea just have not hardly been noticeable.",1
"thank you so much for the advice. caffeine addiction sucks and i know there are so many health benefits to quitting. quitting cold turkey gives me anxiety so your quitting gradually method seems like something i can manage. good luck on getting back on track, you did it once so i know you can do it again",1
"i'm not a medical professional but i can tell you from my own experience that the effects of withdrawal will be much easier to handle if you slowly reduce your intake.  i would tier your intake reduction as a percentage of daily intake. so if your baseline is mg and you decide to reduce by ~% tiers, something like this( some quantities are rounded):  day  baseline mg intake day - reduce total daily intake by mg day to mg day - reduce intake by mg to mg daily day - reduce intake by mg to mg daily day - reduce by mg to mg daily day - reduce by mg to mg daily etc... you might also find it easier to say, """"instead of  rockstar drinks, i will stop at . today and no more."""" just be careful not to reduce too quickly or your withdrawals will probably become more intense. this is why i suggested reducing intake every  days even if it takes much longer.  some people can quit cold turkey but i had pretty bad withdrawals doing a rapid reduction to zero from about mg. just make a plan and stick too it, after you pay the price of some withdrawal symptoms don't make the mistake of upping your dose after.  good luck and stay healthy!",1
"no. caffeine is a powerful drug and it's not because the """"number"""" is low that this dosage doesn't have significative effects on the central nervous system of everyone. you are in r/caffeinefreelife. chocolate is caffeinated. don't come here to advocate caffeine consumption at low dosages.",0

"regardless of what you believe, it worked for me. it eased the withdrawal symptoms dramatically because it interacts with the same neuroreceptors as caffeine. necessary? no. but having a annoying headaches and irritability is better than having crippling headaches, vomiting and who knows what else, which is what happened when i previously tried to quit. i was drinking the equivalent of  pots of coffee or  two liter bottles of diet coke a day and had been addicted for  years before quitting cold in january of this year. made possible by the makers of wellbutrin.",1
"well, op is not ingesting those huge amounts of caffeine you described. no need to go asap to intake another psychoactive drug to quit caffeine. just quit caffeine and confront its withdrawal symptoms that vanish asap.",0
"i have a somewhat stressful job, i have noticed that since taking a break from caffeine my anxiety has reduced. ",1
"one of caffeine side effects is to induce or increase anxiety. you shoud consider quitting caffeine. it's hard to """"love"""" something that harms you! vicious cycle of caffeine explained number  lie about caffeine unmasked ",0
"what you said is correct. most people will overcome caffeine's paws around  -  months after quitting it. but i understand that you can claim that caffeine is unhealthy - in dietary use by healthy people. caffeine is a psychoactive drug that impairs restorative sleep - with vast negative consequences for general health, increases cortisol levels, increases anxiety, increases cholesterol and many, many other known negative effects. in this context, caffeine can be called what it is – a poison to human health. however, caffeine - as a pharmaco - has its role in our pharmacology when used appropriately as a medicine when its pharmacological effects are necessary in the treatment of some diseases and medical conditions.",0
"i've dry fasted and been off caffeine for weeks which felt like a total reset, but i notice that you just can't get the same dopamine release without caffeine which stimulates flow and mental work. if you are on a timeline of any sort, or require very intense mental loads it may have its place. if you are looking to heal your nervous system and restore sleep, then you need to take a break.",1
