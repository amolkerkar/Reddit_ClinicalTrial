that’s very interesting. thank you for sharing your experience. i’d be interested to hear what happens with your anxiety over the next few weeks.
"mostly the opposite, since i've quit caffeine i don't need therapy or medication for mental health issues (ocd/chronic anxiety/insomnia), quitting caffeine has calmed my nervous system. > year off caffiene, had therapy over this year. tried caffiene again and my negative side effects (bar a small withdrawal period) have all but disappeared a lot of people have a similar experience like this, it's important to note that chronic caffeine use damages gaba receptors over time which will lead to a stronger and stronger stress response, source - [chronic caffeine or theophylline exposure reduces gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptor site interactions - pubmed (nih.gov)]( so even when someone quits caffeine for a year, heals their nervous system, and consumes caffeine after a year of abstinence they may feel that it doesn't give them as much anxiety anymore, but that's because their baseline anxiety is lower (as a result of giving their nervous system a large break without the nervous system damaging substance)."
"i feel this post. i’m m and i always thought i  loved coffee until i realized that it was turning my hair gray, preventing me from sleeping adequately, and led me to smoking copious amounts of marijuana to deal with caffeine inflicted anxiety. this combination turned into a vicious cycle of caffeine stimulation in the morning and afternoon and subsequent cannabis use to take the edge off from the caffeine in the evening. i would regularly consume a venti iced black coffee from starbucks throughout the day, sometimes having a grande in the afternoon if i had to work that evening (i’m a bartender). it would be a miracle if i could make it through my shift without getting stoned, as i was so agitated from the caffeine that talking to people was like pulling teeth. i just thought i hated my job and that maybe i was turning into a cynical asshole. nope. it was coffee.  i have tried to quit caffeine upwards of  times within the past year, failing miserably each time until now. each time i failed, i went cold turkey and tried to “tough it out”.  this time i used matcha powder. i found it to be very easy to ween using matcha because the dose is very consistent and precise. there is something like  or so mg of caffeine per teaspoon of matcha. maybe start with two of those in the morning in a latte with milk, one in the afternoon, and a half teaspoon at night.  i’m  days off of my last matcha drink (i tapered down to / of a teaspoon) and i’d be surprised if i ever had caffeine again. good luck with your journey! this forum has been incredibly helpful, so i advise you to continue reaching out for help and kind words. everyone is very supportive and friendly!"
after the first week i felt good for about a week or  then i started to feel a bit of depression. then after about a month i felt pretty good. but the anxiety totally went away like the first few days.
started at  when we had our first coffee machine  to  a cups day till  and then a can of tea a day so yeah i was a fucking hyper kid. so  years of addiction and quit with minimal withdrawal symptoms and  years of weed addiction also quit with minimal withdrawal symptoms with this approach of not giving the brain time to overthink the addiction and just ignoring the process i just don't give it power in my life and i have episodes of fatigue brainfog bouts of depression right now but i just ignore it and as a result i don't feel it impacting me as much i would never rent about it in my head cause that the point the addiction becomes powerful
"get her a moka pot. it’s a stovetop brewer that’s also something that comes close to espresso that’s very affordable. she then could dilute with hot water to make an americano or add milk for italian drinks or sugar and milk for hispanic drinks. they come in various “cups” that measure about ml per “cup”. so a “-cup” is recommended for one person and a “-cup” is recommended for two people. the name brand for these is going to be bialetti. usually i won’t recommend the name brand cause it’s just a name but as a gift i will. also don’t be alarmed when they say “aluminum pot”, they all are aluminum with some models being stainless steel. there’s also the bialetti brikka that makes an espresso-like foam."
"what brand do you recommend for a good decaf coffee? caffeine doesn't wake me up, it just gives me horrible anxiety. but i love the taste of coffee and i don't want to give it up."
hello! ive only been drinking  one cup a day for awhile now. i noticed a huge decrease in my anxiety. i was like you- drinking - cups a day and i was very anxious and jittery. i was actually thinking yesterday about reducing it to no cups. i have tried that before but i was really tired. and that’s the only reason i went back to drinking one. the main reason i reduced my caffeine intake was due to anxiety. one you get past the withdrawal and the bad headaches it’s not that bad if you stop drinking it. i did get to that point before and i felt really good with out drinking coffee.
it should help anxiety but some people temporarily get worse from the withdrawal in the first few weeks / months
"quitting caffeine reduced my anxiety quite a bit, but this was something that took a few weeks to fully take effect. i didn’t have a full-blown migraine from quitting, but i did have a bad headache that lasted a few days.  one other cool thing that happened after i quit (and the short term side effects like that headache) went away is that my sleep improved significantly in both quantity and quality."
"my anxiety hugely decreased. i was constantly anxious and pissed off daily when i was on caffeine ( mg caffeine pill daily or energy drinks for the past  years or so) and had no clue that a good % of that was due to caffeine. i just thought i had some weirdly intense lifelong anxiety issue.  it took me  weeks of being totally off of caffeine before i really felt markedly better, so maybe when you stopped you just hadn’t given it enough time yet. i had headaches and bad fatigue for at least  weeks after stopping, but after that went away i’ve been feeling soooo much better!"
"i feel less anxiety too. my skin condition gets better too which is a big reason to help me to keep going. when i feel terrible, i see myself in the mirror then decide to have no coffee today. in case you want to know the details about my anxiety in the past, i used to be the person who always wanted to do something even i am entitled to rest in my career break."
how long did it take for your anxiety to completely reduce?
"i happened to be on my phone just now, so quick reply time! i haven’t been keeping track this time, but i am -. weeks deep. definitely better than my last attempt, largely because there wasn’t much of a withdrawal. i’m so glad i’m not sucking down coffees to try and feel better. the anxiety decrease is real. as is the sleep enhancement. i’ve still had the occasional decaf and the odd granola bar and ice cream with chocolate in it, so i’m technically not totally caffeine free, but i was doing + coffees a day before, so the change is stark enough. i was an angry, moody bastard on coffee, because of the headaches (which have disappeared!). it’s obvious now that the headaches were just due to withdrawal and being in-between fixes. i still have the occasional day of body and neck pain, but i’m fairly early in this thing and there are other factors that contribute to that shit."
i gave up caffeine about a week ago and just realized today that my anxiety is much better!!
i have a severe addiction and gone cold turkey myself too. its really difficult and im constantly dealing with my mind playing me games especially focused on health anxiety. today is day . wish me luck and stay strong!
"wean off caffeine slowly over the course of a few weeks. i was a longtime heavy caffeine drinker (over mg minimum per day) and i quit cold turkey. that was a mistake! my withdrawal symptoms were severe. worse than any website like webmd, etc., describes withdrawal symptoms. i had severe migraines, neck pain, brain fog, back pain, burning sensations, and anxiety for almost a month. i never had those symptoms before. i honestly thought i had brain cancer, or some other nervous system disorder. it was terrible and adversely affected work, parenting, and school. i stuck with it and have not had caffeine in months. i feel a lot better now and i don't rely on caffeine to feel normal. i sleep well and feel rested. i have more consistent energy throughout the day instead of having up and down spikes depending on when i get my fix. after comparing how i felt on caffeine and how i feel now, i can definitely say that heavy caffeine use is not healthy. try cutting your intake by % each week over the course of a few weeks. trade out caffeinated drinks with something else such as gatorade zero, or light lemonade, etc. drink lots of water as it will help flush your system and keep you hydrated. good luck!"
yes all normal withdrawal symptoms. come over to /r/decaf. lot's of info on this.
"dude! i’m not an exaggerator. i’ve been to the doctor  times. you may have a different tolerance for things, but you seem to have a history of being very dismissive of caffeine withdrawal.  it wouldn’t take a genius to figure this thing out. caffeine is the only common denominator. period. i’ve had several blood test, chest x rays, echocardiogram, stress test and all. everything comes back fine i don’t drink. i don’t smoke. i don’t even eat chocolate or coffee. i don’t engage in crazy things. i study. the only thing i do is workout. used supplemental caffeine (preworkout).  it’s not just coffee. ask questions, but don’t be dismissive of people’s experiences man. people turn to this for affirmation that they’re not alone and that other people are going through the same thing. just because you’ve never experienced it, doesn’t mean others aren’t.  i know what a caffeine headache is when originally quitting. that’s just from sodas. this wasn’t just a soda, coffee, or tea. it was something much larger. "
"why?  because i've done it before and everyone reacts differently to these things and here's how it was last time: flu-like symptoms (minus fever or vomiting of course), massive lethargy so that i couldn't do barely anything, depression, mood swings, and on day twelve it was still just as bad as day  and i had no idea when it would end.  i used to do cold turkey and it didn't last as long for some reason, but i have no reason to believe it won't be like that again, and while i do have some time off from work for the holidays, i don't have twelve days and i can't work feeling like that or really do much of anything.  if i just have at least like  cups i can probably manage to do some stuff.  plus, i take klonopin which makes me tired and that probably makes it harder for me to abstain from caffeine than you because the caffeine balances it out so i'm not so tired from it, but it also makes me more anxious so i need more klonopin so if i can manage to drink less coffee i'll need less klonopin and that will be good.  you can't expect everyone will react the same way to substances or withdrawal as you do because people have different biochemistry.  on the other hand, cutting down slowly is no good either.  what i can do is just drink as little as possible.  that won't really prolong the suffering so badly."
"more consistent mood and emotional state. overall less stress and anxiety too, i've found. like what / alluded to, waking up without feeling like a zombie or in need of a drug to get you going is huge."
"you should associate that beverage to the harmful anxiety effects it causes, and not to the pleasure of its flavor. change your mindset and get rid of that psychological dependence to that beverage. that beverage should be something that now belongs to your past. go out there and discover new flavors that are also benign to your overal health. discover chamomile flower tea that will make wonders to your anxiety and good restorative sleep. start to put your global health in the first place."
"first understand. you've never quit caffeine, yet! you only started multiple periods of caffeine abstinence - suffered the acute caffeine withdrawal symptoms - never crossed beyond the acute caffeine withdrawal phase - and came back to the vice - in an irrational pattern justified by your lack of qualified information about how to quit caffeine successfully. to quit caffeine is to stay in full caffeine abstinence for at least six month. only after that timeframe someone can state ""i quit caffeine""! prediction of acute caffeine withdrawal symptoms  but you should not exceed  minutes napping - otherwise you'll mess with restorative night sleep chamomile flower tea will help you with anxiety and good sleep. top  benefits of chamomile for anxiety | how chamomile helps to relieve anxiety & how to take it "
"i went without caffeine for  months over the summer and felt great, not sure if it was cause i was low stress or cause of no caffeine but i’m willing to try it once again. thanks for the information"
you were low stress because you were not ingesting caffeine for  months.
caffeine induces stress! caffeine induces cortisol generation above normal levels - cortisol is the stress hormone.

"from your current dosage, you can go cold turkey right now. why prolong this suffering? prediction of acute caffeine withdrawal symptoms  but you should not exceed  minutes napping - otherwise you'll mess with restorative night sleep"
"look - you are still quitting caffeine! quitting a powerful drug like caffeine implies suffering a period of withdrawal and post withdrawal symptoms. that is where you are right now. you are still crossing the river to a caffeine-free life. so... it is inappropriate to state: ""i quit caffeine and had a decrease in my quality of life"". because you are still suffering withdrawal symptoms - they are responsible for temporarily decreasing your quality of life. it's the same thing as an alcoholic stating that ""i quit alcohol and that decreased my quality of life"" - just two weeks of alcohol abstinence. all of this is temporary and represents the normal course of healing from caffeine addiction. if you don't confront these symptoms until they vanish, you'll always be addicted to that drug."

"we do know, it's simple.  by that logic, since we have endocannabinoid receptors in our brains, does that mean everyone should try marijuana to see if it benefits them?  caffeine is a drug, and i am not demonizing it. obviously though if more and more people, including me, wake up with • strong cravings • poor thinking • reduce appetite(for me that means not gaining weight, and losing muscle mass  • disturbed deep sleep, deep sleep is needed for muscle repair,proper cognitve functioning, and matneince  • scattered thoughts when consuming caffeine, along with chronic anxiety and stress levels how is anything like this ""good for you"" long term? these things should be idolized?"
"caffeine is a powerful psychoactive stimulant drug. after months or years of caffeine dependence, your entire body and central nervous system are reprogrammed to deal with the daily attacks of this stimulant drug. when you stop taking that powerful stimulant drug, your central nervous system and your entire body need a long time to return to their original functioning. typically, this can take three to six months. but things improve week after week. i would suggest you to drink chamomile flower tea  minutes before bedtime. chamomile flower tea is a natural and nonaddictive calming tea that makes wonders to sleep and anxiety. important - never ingest a single molecule of caffeine, or you'll be compromissing your healing process - stay away from that poison. decaf beverages and chocolate contain caffeine. be patient! give your central nervous system a chance to heal from your former caffeine addiction."
caffeine has a long half life that's why your addicted body is missing it during sleep. currently your body is stressed cause you took away it's drug
that's for you to decide. i think life is healthier without caffeine. i'm under the impression that a lot people would be less irritated and anxious if they dropped the caffeine.
"congratutalions on your decision to quit caffeine! are you drinking decaf coffee/tea, or eating/drinking chocolate? are you taking headache pills? many headache pills contain caffeine. anyway, headaches should disappear very soon - usually it only endures less than a week. it's normal to feel unmotivated during the first weeks or months after quitting caffeine. after all, caffeine is a stimulant drug and your central nervous system needs some time to rebalance to auto generate motivation again in the natural way of doing it. prediction of acute caffeine withdrawal symptoms  but you should not exceed  minutes napping - otherwise you'll mess with restorative night sleep"

"i do cold showers to wake up, exercise more often, & eat less carbs & more fat & protein - carbs make glucose in the blood rise & then crash, without caffeine i am more sensitive to that. i don't do naps, i feel terrible after. be mindful it will be at least  -  weeks for the critical withdrawal symptoms, past that you'll start feeling better. be patient for now, & don't neglect good sleep & good hydration, incorporate trace minerals &/or a pinch of a good salt (celctic, himalayan) to your water to improve brain fog."
