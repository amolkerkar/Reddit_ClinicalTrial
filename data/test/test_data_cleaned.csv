SeveralString5058,"i feel this post. i’m m and i always thought i  loved coffee until i realized that it was turning my hair gray, preventing me from sleeping adequately, and led me to smoking copious amounts of marijuana to deal with caffeine inflicted anxiety. this combination turned into a vicious cycle of caffeine stimulation in the morning and afternoon and subsequent cannabis use to take the edge off from the caffeine in the evening. i would regularly consume a venti iced black coffee from starbucks throughout the day, sometimes having a grande in the afternoon if i had to work that evening (i’m a bartender). it would be a miracle if i could make it through my shift without getting stoned, as i was so agitated from the caffeine that talking to people was like pulling teeth. i just thought i hated my job and that maybe i was turning into a cynical asshole. nope. it was coffee.  i have tried to quit caffeine upwards of  times within the past year, failing miserably each time until now. each time i failed, i went cold turkey and tried to “tough it out”.  this time i used matcha powder. i found it to be very easy to ween using matcha because the dose is very consistent and precise. there is something like  or so mg of caffeine per teaspoon of matcha. maybe start with two of those in the morning in a latte with milk, one in the afternoon, and a half teaspoon at night.  i’m  days off of my last matcha drink (i tapered down to / of a teaspoon) and i’d be surprised if i ever had caffeine again. good luck with your journey! this forum has been incredibly helpful, so i advise you to continue reaching out for help and kind words. everyone is very supportive and friendly!",decaf
Petersonos,"sorry to hear you are having such a bad time with caffeine, sounds like you might sensitive to caffeine like me.. also caffeine would mask any other underlying condition you might have which might explain the depression even when  you are drinking caffeine.. what's your diet like?   also do you smoke? also do you exercise enough? you might benefit from quitting caffeine all together, i'm in the same situation as yourself, i'm quitting caffeine and smoking tomorrow which i'm not looking forward to as tge withdrawals are brutal...",decaf
uhvoidance,after the first week i felt good for about a week or  then i started to feel a bit of depression. then after about a month i felt pretty good. but the anxiety totally went away like the first few days.,decaf
lightwear12,started at  when we had our first coffee machine  to  a cups day till  and then a can of tea a day so yeah i was a fucking hyper kid. so  years of addiction and quit with minimal withdrawal symptoms and  years of weed addiction also quit with minimal withdrawal symptoms with this approach of not giving the brain time to overthink the addiction and just ignoring the process i just don't give it power in my life and i have episodes of fatigue brainfog bouts of depression right now but i just ignore it and as a result i don't feel it impacting me as much i would never rent about it in my head cause that the point the addiction becomes powerful,decaf
fuhgg_,"before i quit completely i was down to just  cups per day, sometimes supplementing a cup of coffee with a cup of green tea. and still the difference to my anxiety levels when i finally quit was life changing. i think my anxiety condition makes me unable to use any amount of caffeine. i also see your point about moderation. in the years before i quit i realized that i was drinking too much, maybe  cups in a day. i would repeatedly reduce my intake to  cups only to have it drift back up to  or more within a couple weeks totally unconsciously.",decaf
decafDiva,"i've been having just one cup a day for the past -ish years, never really had a desire to have more, but cutting down has felt near impossible. i'm extremely sensitive to caffeine, so any change in the amount i have i feel intensely. i've been slowly tapering down for the last  months (yeah, it's taking me a while...), and i've felt huge benefits just going from my usual  oz cup down to  oz (i stayed at  oz for several months). better sleep, way less anxiety, i don't have to pee  thousand times a day, less migraines, and an improvement in reflux. i didn't feel any desire to have more than that  oz once i got past the first couple of weeks. so this doesn't at all feel like an alcoholic's experience with alcohol, at least not for me.",decaf
anxious_math_student,"to me there is no amount of coffee that i can consume without being overwhelmed by anxiety. when i was younger, i used to drink - espressos per day (although that was already too much and interferes with my sleep), but i became increasingly sensitive to caffeine/coffee (caffeine is definitely a factor, but decaf and dark chocolate also makes me feel funny). limiting myself to  coffee at the peak of my consumption would have been a good idea, right now it’s not an option anymore.",decaf
himmokala,"okay, that's interesting. however, alcohol causes physically worse and more dangerous withdrawal symptoms.",decaf
-Smaug,"i'd argue being  days in and feeling unmotivated and depressed is % a physical symptom.  caffeine physically impacts our brain in a number of ways. one of the most well known is that it increases dopamine and increases dopamine receptors. so we get more dopamine and more receptors for dopamine so we can handle it better.   so we have increased dopamine and increased capacity for dopamine.  then you take increased dopamine away when you quit caffeine.  the physical symptoms of low dopamine? lack of motivation, fatigue, anxiousness, brain fog, etc.. these are physical symptoms you have to outlast.  your dopamine will find a new baseline and regulate, but not in four days.",decaf
Wisebanana83,"if the withdrawal is that bad, i would suggest you taper off coffee. thats what i did. i went from a large everyday, to a medium, then a small. i then started to spill a quarter of the coffee, then half a week or two later...etc. the trick is to spill the coffee out first, rather than say you will only drink half...which never happens. how fast you want to taper really depends on your tolerance for withdrawal symptoms.",decaf
Hoggy1983x,"i did  months and i've sadly now gone back to caffeine. i'm fully aware i'm going to suffer from my previous issues but i was finding myself really struggling and it was affecting my work. it seems that with caffeine i'm anxious, without i'm depressed. i just don't have the lifestyle to ride it out for  months, currently.",decaf
Fr05t_B1t,"get her a moka pot. it’s a stovetop brewer that’s also something that comes close to espresso that’s very affordable. she then could dilute with hot water to make an americano or add milk for italian drinks or sugar and milk for hispanic drinks. they come in various “cups” that measure about ml per “cup”. so a “-cup” is recommended for one person and a “-cup” is recommended for two people. the name brand for these is going to be bialetti. usually i won’t recommend the name brand cause it’s just a name but as a gift i will. also don’t be alarmed when they say “aluminum pot”, they all are aluminum with some models being stainless steel. there’s also the bialetti brikka that makes an espresso-like foam.",coffee

SecondDoorOnTheLeft,"quitting caffeine reduced my anxiety quite a bit, but this was something that took a few weeks to fully take effect. i didn’t have a full-blown migraine from quitting, but i did have a bad headache that lasted a few days.  one other cool thing that happened after i quit (and the short term side effects like that headache) went away is that my sleep improved significantly in both quantity and quality.",CaffeineRecovery

djboarderman,"wean off caffeine slowly over the course of a few weeks. i was a longtime heavy caffeine drinker (over mg minimum per day) and i quit cold turkey. that was a mistake! my withdrawal symptoms were severe. worse than any website like webmd, etc., describes withdrawal symptoms. i had severe migraines, neck pain, brain fog, back pain, burning sensations, and anxiety for almost a month. i never had those symptoms before. i honestly thought i had brain cancer, or some other nervous system disorder. it was terrible and adversely affected work, parenting, and school. i stuck with it and have not had caffeine in months. i feel a lot better now and i don't rely on caffeine to feel normal. i sleep well and feel rested. i have more consistent energy throughout the day instead of having up and down spikes depending on when i get my fix. after comparing how i felt on caffeine and how i feel now, i can definitely say that heavy caffeine use is not healthy. try cutting your intake by % each week over the course of a few weeks. trade out caffeinated drinks with something else such as gatorade zero, or light lemonade, etc. drink lots of water as it will help flush your system and keep you hydrated. good luck!",CaffeineRecovery
4hkyle,"dude! i’m not an exaggerator. i’ve been to the doctor  times. you may have a different tolerance for things, but you seem to have a history of being very dismissive of caffeine withdrawal.  it wouldn’t take a genius to figure this thing out. caffeine is the only common denominator. period. i’ve had several blood test, chest x rays, echocardiogram, stress test and all. everything comes back fine i don’t drink. i don’t smoke. i don’t even eat chocolate or coffee. i don’t engage in crazy things. i study. the only thing i do is workout. used supplemental caffeine (preworkout).  it’s not just coffee. ask questions, but don’t be dismissive of people’s experiences man. people turn to this for affirmation that they’re not alone and that other people are going through the same thing. just because you’ve never experienced it, doesn’t mean others aren’t.  i know what a caffeine headache is when originally quitting. that’s just from sodas. this wasn’t just a soda, coffee, or tea. it was something much larger.

CrayonViking,"> but you seem to have a history of being very dismissive of caffeine withdrawal.  i don't doubt there is withdrawal, because i went thru it for a few days after i quit. > it’s not just coffee. ask questions, but don’t be dismissive of people’s experiences man i am going to be dismissive of all your symptoms--as they stand to quitting caffeine, tho. they are just way too severe for fucking quitting coffee, and i feel there is something way more serious. but hey, i'm not a doctor and if you want to think all that shit happened because you quit caffeine, then you do you. i'm worried for your health, but at the end of the day, i don't know you, so you do what you feel is right for you.",NoCaf
CrayonViking,"doesn't matter. your symptoms seem way over the top and more serious for someone quitting caffeine.  i'm not saying that there isn't something wrong with you, i am saying that it may have been other stimulants or something in what you were drinking, because your symptoms seem to be very very serious. pre-workouts have been pretty notorious for being dangerous in the past. and i don't think it's just the caffeine in them. but hey, i don't care. you do you. if you want to keep blaming this on caffeine, cool.  ",NoCaf
Inaramshead,"why?  because i've done it before and everyone reacts differently to these things and here's how it was last time: flu-like symptoms (minus fever or vomiting of course), massive lethargy so that i couldn't do barely anything, depression, mood swings, and on day twelve it was still just as bad as day  and i had no idea when it would end.  i used to do cold turkey and it didn't last as long for some reason, but i have no reason to believe it won't be like that again, and while i do have some time off from work for the holidays, i don't have twelve days and i can't work feeling like that or really do much of anything.  if i just have at least like  cups i can probably manage to do some stuff.  plus, i take klonopin which makes me tired and that probably makes it harder for me to abstain from caffeine than you because the caffeine balances it out so i'm not so tired from it, but it also makes me more anxious so i need more klonopin so if i can manage to drink less coffee i'll need less klonopin and that will be good.  you can't expect everyone will react the same way to substances or withdrawal as you do because people have different biochemistry.  on the other hand, cutting down slowly is no good either.  what i can do is just drink as little as possible.  that won't really prolong the suffering so badly.",NoCaf

Electronic_Fix6760,"we do know, it's simple.  by that logic, since we have endocannabinoid receptors in our brains, does that mean everyone should try marijuana to see if it benefits them?  caffeine is a drug, and i am not demonizing it. obviously though if more and more people, including me, wake up with • strong cravings • poor thinking • reduce appetite(for me that means not gaining weight, and losing muscle mass  • disturbed deep sleep, deep sleep is needed for muscle repair,proper cognitve functioning, and matneince  • scattered thoughts when consuming caffeine, along with chronic anxiety and stress levels how is anything like this ""good for you"" long term? these things should be idolized?",CaffeineFreeLife
SauloIvanRegis,"caffeine is a powerful psychoactive stimulant drug. after months or years of caffeine dependence, your entire body and central nervous system are reprogrammed to deal with the daily attacks of this stimulant drug. when you stop taking that powerful stimulant drug, your central nervous system and your entire body need a long time to return to their original functioning. typically, this can take three to six months. but things improve week after week. i would suggest you to drink chamomile flower tea  minutes before bedtime. chamomile flower tea is a natural and nonaddictive calming tea that makes wonders to sleep and anxiety. important - never ingest a single molecule of caffeine, or you'll be compromissing your healing process - stay away from that poison. decaf beverages and chocolate contain caffeine. be patient! give your central nervous system a chance to heal from your former caffeine addiction.",CaffeineFreeLife

SauloIvanRegis,"congratutalions on your decision to quit caffeine! are you drinking decaf coffee/tea, or eating/drinking chocolate? are you taking headache pills? many headache pills contain caffeine. anyway, headaches should disappear very soon - usually it only endures less than a week. it's normal to feel unmotivated during the first weeks or months after quitting caffeine. after all, caffeine is a stimulant drug and your central nervous system needs some time to rebalance to auto generate motivation again in the natural way of doing it. prediction of acute caffeine withdrawal symptoms  but you should not exceed  minutes napping - otherwise you'll mess with restorative night sleep",CaffeineFreeLife
